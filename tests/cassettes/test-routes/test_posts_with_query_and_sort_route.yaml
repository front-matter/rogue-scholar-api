        The Papermill Alarm has grown to become a comprehensive mix\\nof methods for
        detecting organised research fraud and simplifying a\\ncomplex problem. But
        there's something new. Something bigger and better\\nfrom Clear\_Skies.\\n\\nDo
        you know what an \\\"SEP field\\\" is? It's from Douglas\_Adams:\\n\\n> An
        SEP is something we can't see, or don't see, or our brain doesn't\\n> let
        us see, because we think that it's somebody else's problem. That's\\n> what
        SEP means. Somebody Else's Problem. The brain just edits it out,\\n> it's
        like a blind\_spot.\\n\\nI used to think the \\\"SEP field\\\"\u200A---\u200Aa
        fictional tool for making\\nsomething invisible\u200A---\u200Awas a just a
        joke, but the more I think about it\\nthe more I think it's a real\_thing.\\n\\nI'd
        spent a chunk of COVID lockdown working out a scalable solution to\\nthe papermill
        detection problem. Papermills were a small part of what I\\nwanted to do with
        Clear Skies, but it was already clear to me at that\\ntime that this was going
        to be a big project. I made this solution into\\nan API (called \\\"Papermill
        Alarm\\\" available via RapidAPI) allowing\\npublishers to self-serve and
        screen their submissions for problematic\\ncontent. The Papermill Alarm was
        the first commercial service\\n*dedicated* to papermill detection (but it's
        probably worth mentioning\\nthat it wasn't the first papermill detector that
        we released\u200A---\u200A[that\\nwas the duplicate submission check in the
        Clear Skies Article\\nTracker](https://medium.com/@clearskiesadam/how-to-find-all-the-papermills-step-1-f00c624facb1)).\\n\\nSome
        publishers were quick to hop onto the API and start using it. By\\nand large,
        it was used responsibly and it felt great to know that the\\nservice was helping
        people. Sadly, there was a small amount of abuse of\\nthat service by papermills
        (and even by one publisher), so the free\\nversion was short-lived, but I
        think it showed that papermill detection\\nwas a tractable problem.\\n\\nThe
        whole time, there was something in the back of my\_mind.\\n\\nIt must have
        been at least a decade ago. I was editing a journal and I\\nsaw a referee
        make the best catch I've ever seen. A manuscript was sent\\nto him for review
        and he responded with a copy of a published paper\\nwritten in his native
        language. He pointed out\_that\\n\\n- the published paper was identical to
        the manuscript I'd sent him\\n  except the one I had sent him had been translated
        to English\_and\\n- the original, which had been published some time previously,
        had\\n  different author names on\_it.\\n- So it looked like someone had simply
        translated a paper, put their own\\n  name on it and sent it off for review
        hoping to get a paper published\\n  without actually doing any research.\\n\\nIt
        was really odd, but the team handled it like your typical plagiarism\\ncase.
        The matter was investigated, the manuscript was rejected, and the\\nauthors
        were warned off repeat behaviour.\\n\\nEven after it was all finished, something
        was bothering me, but it went\\nto the back of my\_mind.\\n\\nHop forward
        to late-2022 and it was clear that there was demand for the\\nPapermill Alarm,
        but that early version needed to\_develop.\\n\\n[I've always viewed misconduct
        detection as a network analysis\\nproblem](https://medium.com/@clearskiesadam/papermills-in-peer-review-c507b12aa4ac).\\nIndeed,
        it turns out that network analysis is the primary analytical\\nmethod employed
        for fraud detection in other industries, too.\\n\\nOne method that was in
        constant development from shortly after the\\nPapermill Alarm's initial release
        was 'Keystone'. [That was about\\nfinding the individuals most-connected to
        research\\nfraud](https://medium.com/@clearskiesadam/keystone-papermill-detection-with-network-analysis-3a48de927406).\\nThe
        choice of name isn't an accident. The keystone in a building is\\nusually
        the one that holds it all together\u200A---\u200Aif you remove a brick\\nfrom
        a structure, it will probably be ok, but remove the keystone and it\\nall
        falls down. I think that these individuals are structurally\\nimportant to
        the networks of bad actors that perpetuate research fraud.\\nIf we're going
        to point limited resources at investigations we should\\ntarget the dealers,
        not the users. So this shows where we\\nmight\_focus\_our\_efforts.\\n\\nBy
        early 2023, misconduct detection was clearly in-vogue. So we expanded\\nthe
        tool to cover all areas of science as well as adding new detection\\npipelines
        and an introductory version (called \\\"Papermill Alarm: Public\\\")\\nfor
        cases where data was limited.\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nThen I heard a story. An
        author had submitted a paper to a journal, only\\nto be accused of plagiarism.
        The journal had already received an\\nidentical paper with different authorship.\\n\\nBut
        the author protested and insisted that the paper was their own\\noriginal
        work. They hadn't shared it, *but they had written the work in\\ntheir native
        language, and then sent it to a translation company to be\\ntranslated to
        English.* So it seemed that the paper had been translated\\nby the translation
        company and that the translation company had then\\nsold the manuscript to
        different 'authors' before the real authors had\\nthe chance to publish\_it.\\n\\nIsn't
        that\_awful?\\n\\nAnd that was what had been gnawing at the back of my mind
        for all those\\nyears. *It's too much work, isn't it*? If someone couldn't
        be bothered\\nto write their own paper, why take the time to translate a paper,
        why\\nnot just make something up or copy/paste something already in English\\n(this
        was before the days of plagiarism detection)? There had to be an\\nintermediary.
        Someone who was already doing the translation work anyway\\nwho could gain
        further by selling the manuscript.\\n\\nBut the other thing was realising
        that, despite all that time spent\\nstudying papermills, I had encountered
        one and not even realised\_it.\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nI learned some valuable lessons\_there.\\n\\n-
        First: in a plagiarism case, it is absolutely possible for the fake to\\n
        \ be published before the original.\\n- Second: it was very easy for me to
        focus on my own remit\u200A---\u200Amy job\\n  was to manage the journal and
        deal with occasional research fraud\\n  cases. It wasn't my problem to understand
        the mechanisms by which that\\n  fraud was happening industrially, that's
        an\_SEP.\\n\\nI think that that's one reason why the scale of the papermill
        problem\\nwas never really understood until recently\u200A---\u200Awe only
        ever saw one\\ntentacle at a time and it was no one's job to tug on them.
        Papermills\\nare great at hiding in plain\_sight.\\n\\n[By the end of 2023,
        the scope of the Papermill Alarm was comprehensive.\\nWe had unique Oversight
        of the whole problem. Its history, its methods,\\nand\_scale.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03464-x)\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/549/1*S6yP5iDlszTWs9OI5486-g.png\\\"

        the Papermill Alarm\_API.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nInterestingly, we
        had also already built a method which could\u200A---\u200Aquite\\nby accident\u200A---\u200Adetect
        the behaviour described above. Again, the\\nduplicate check in the Article
        Tracker would potentially catch a case\\nlike this at the moment of submission
        (but it would still be up to the\\ninvestigator to work out which paper was
        the original).\\n\\nOne key thing here is that, as we see patterns emerging
        that 'plain\\nsight' part becomes acutely\_obvious.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*S437zT85OUIDwLpQi-qYpg.png\\\"

        start of 2023 (we get better accuracy now). I haven\u2019t shared it\\npublicly
        before because I was concerned it could be harmful. At this\\npoint, though,
        I think the issues at Hindawi are widely known. That\\nsaid, if I ever needed
        to convince anyone that the Papermill Alarm\\nworked, this image was enough.
        It\u2019s clear that the growth coincided with\\nthe alerts and that the stream

        for a few bespoke use-cases. It was then upgraded\\nto full industry-level
        coverage. I'd like to extend my thanks to\\neveryone who gave feedback on
        the service. We're very grateful for\\nyour\_support.\\n\\nThere's a lot coming
        here. But let's come back to it in another post.\\nFor more information, [contact\_us](https://clear-skies.co.uk/contact/).\\n\\n####
        Addendum\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*My definition of 'papermill' is 'organised research
        fraud' or, more\\nnerdily, 'any repeatable pattern of fraudulent behaviour'.
        So, commit\\nfraud once and that's bad, but do it twice and you're on the
        radar. So a\\ntranslation service that sells manuscripts constitutes a papermill.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*I
        think that Clear Skies can claim the first 'detection' of a\\nChatGPT-generated
        paper ([I'm not sure if 'detection' is the right\\nword\u200A---\u200Ait was
        just a Google\\nsearch](https://x.com/ClearSkiesAdam/status/1647861389573103617)!).
        But\\nthat was one route we didn't go down. Technical solutions for genAI-text\\ndetection
        are dubious at best and, even at that time, it was clear that\\nthe legitimate
        use-cases for genAI were going to eclipse the fraudulent\\nones. I think there
        are useful applications for genAI-related fraud\\ndetection, but it's\_nuanced.\\n\\n![](https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=85e51803cbfa){width=\\\"1\\\"\\nheight=\\\"1\\\"}\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/g718f-4kk96\",\"guid\":\"https://medium.com/p/85e51803cbfa\",\"id\":\"d4c34c53-98a7-4df2-a8e3-5dad203dac9c\",\"image\":\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZCIW-42TiMHET6-AQOY-gA.png\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1735729688,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"rid\":\"9fvex-wqy51\",\"status\":\"active\",\"summary\":\"<strong>\\n

        most years, a mixed bag for me here. Kidney failure continues to be\\na truly
        challenging medical fiasco, with AV fistulas, overnight\\ndialysis, hormone
        therapies, and much much more. I also continue to feel\\nthe severe difficulties
        of my rheumatoid arthritis, which required a hip\\nreplacement in April.\\n\\nFor
        most of this year, I worked at Crossref -- until I was made\\nredundant (at
        the end of November) due to the abolition of Crossref Labs\\n(as anyone on
        LinkedIn will be able to see, almost all members of the\\nLabs/R&D team are
        now looking for work and the remaining member on the\\nCrossref website is
        listed as now belonging to the \\\"data science\\\"\\ndepartment instead of
        R&D). This was deeply frustrating. I was hired to\\nstart in January 2023.
        It is well known that I am a vulnerable\\nindividual with serious long-term
        (in fact, terminal) health conditions,\\nmost notably kidney failure that
        requires dialysis 5 times per week. I\\nwas hired away from a tenured-equivalent
        full Professorship at a\\nuniversity; a very secure position. Yet, relatively
        soon after starting,\\nmy department was abolished.\\n\\nI should note that
        my performance at Crossref was never questioned. My\\nannual development review
        feedback was extremely positive and I was told\\nthat the redundancy was no
        reflection on my performance. My work at\\nCrossref -- and particularly my
        publication record while there -- has\\nattracted great attention and been
        covered in/by *Nature News*, *New\\nScientist* (23rd March 2024, p. 48), *Ars

        Blog*, the\\n*Digital Preservation Coalition*, *CLOCKSS*, *Research Buzz*,
        *InfoDoc\\nMicroVeille*, *DigitalKoans*, and *FE News*. Furthermore, earlier
        this\\nyear I was awarded the Association of University Presses StandUP Award.\\nI
        was particularly pleased that *Nature* [ran an editorial just recently\\nstarting
        with my digital preservation\\nwork](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03842-z)
        indicating the\\nclear community value of this work. It is a shame that I
        won't get to\\ncontinue this work at Crossref.\\n\\nIt is also, in my opinion,
        a shame that Labs is no more and I do not\\nunderstand the decision when,
        as above, we were attracting such\\ncommunity interest. The Crossref R&D Department
        (\\\"Labs\\\") has been\\nresponsible for so many of their community successes
        over the past two\\ndecades and more recently. Similarity Check, ORCID, CrossMark,
        the REST\\nAPI, Participation Reports, Metadata Search, Funder Ref, ROR, Chooser,\\nLabs
        Reports, Matching, and Retraction Watch were all products\\noriginally of
        the Labs/R&D team.\\n\\nIn any case, moving on. I did quite a bit of publishing
        and writing this\\nyear, with a fair few pieces lined up for near future.\\n\\n###

        mensch einmal anf\xE4ngt, darauf zu achten, erweist sich Wissenschaft\\nan
        vielen Stellen als ein erstaunlich schmutziges Gesch\xE4ft. Das ist\\nallen
        irgendwie an der Wissenschaft Beteiligten klar. Ebenso wissen\\nalle, wie
        sehr die Sonntagsreden und -bilder von selbstlos und nur der\\nWahrheit verpflichteten
        Forschenden, die in B\xFCros und Laboren, in\\nBibliotheken und Archiven,
        auf Feldforschung und bei Ausgrabungen einzig\\nvom Wunsch getrieben sind,
        den Menschen zu helfen, die Welt besser zu\\nmachen und die bestm\xF6gliche
        Wissenschaftspraxis zu betreiben, ein\\nIdealbild darstellen. Mit der kleinteiligen
        und vielschichtigen Realit\xE4t\\nder Wissenschaft hat das erfahrungsgem\xE4\xDF
        wenig zu tun.\\nWissenschaftler\\\\*innen sind Menschen, mit allen ihren Fehlern,\\nindividuellen
        Interessen und Motivationen sowie blinden Flecken. So\\nweit, so erwartbar.
        Nicht jede\\\\*r muss idealistisch sein.\\n\\nProblematisch wird es jedoch,
        wenn das Ideal nicht mehr Zielpunkt,\\nsondern nur noch eine Fassade ist,
        hinter der ganz bewusst gemauschelt,\\nbetrogen und missbraucht wird. Oder
        wenn Wissenschaft zur Zielscheibe\\noder zum Werkzeug f\xFCr Scamming, Vort\xE4uschung
        und Manipulation wird.\_\\n\\nDann entsteht schnell der Eindruck, dass es
        nicht nur um einzelne\\nPersonen geht, die vielleicht unter Leistungs- und
        Publikationsdruck\\nstehen und deshalb Daten f\xE4lschen oder bereits publizierte
        Artikel\\nmehrfach einreichen. Vielmehr entsteht die Sorge, dass teilweise
        mit\\nkrimineller Energie vorgegangen wird.\\n\\n\xDCberrascht das? Eher nicht,
        wenn mensch sich ansieht, wie viel Geld im\\nWissenschaftssystem vorhanden
        ist, wie viel Macht eine\\nWissenschaftskarriere mit sich bringen kann und
        wie sich\\nwissenschaftliche Reputation in externe Gewinne f\xFCr Expert\\\\*innen,\\nBerater\\\\*innen,
        Autor\\\\*innen \xFCbersetzen l\xE4sst.\\n\\nAuch ist die Vergabe von Forschungsmitteln
        und Professuren mittlerweile\\nstark an die Messbarkeit von Erfolg gebunden
        mit Parametern wie dem\\nHirsch-Index, der als vermeintlich objektiver Indikator
        f\xFCr Reputation,\\nausgedr\xFCckt durch die Anzahl der Publikationen und
        Zitationen einer\\nPerson, gilt. Das Wissenschaftssystem erzeugt damit einen
        immensen\\nDruck, der sichtbare und messbare Erfolge einfordert und der durch
        die\\nRestriktionen des deutschen Wissenschaftszeitvertragsgesetzes\\nunerbittlich
        auf die Forschenden einwirkt. Werden keine Gelder\\neingeworben und der n\xE4chste
        Karriereschritt nicht in den vorgegebenen\\nZeitfenstern erreicht, bedeutet
        das f\xFCr viele, oftmals hochqualifizierte\\nMenschen, nicht mehr im deutschen
        Wissenschaftsbereich arbeiten zu\\nk\xF6nnen -- und damit im Wesentlichen
        nicht einer Forschungst\xE4tigkeit\\nnachgehen zu k\xF6nnen. Zu diesen prek\xE4ren
        Besch\xE4ftigungsverh\xE4ltnissen in\\nAkademia informieren unter anderem
        die Social-Media-Diskurse\\n\\\\#IchBinHanna oder \\\\#IchBinReyhan.\\n\\n#
        Beispiele {#beispiele .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nEine ganze Anzahl von wissenschaftstypischen,
        betr\xFCgerischen Praktiken\\nsind in gewisser Weise schon etabliert: Zitationskartelle;\\nAutor\\\\*innenschaften
        von Personen, die gar nicht an einer Publikation\\nbeteiligt waren; Beitr\xE4ge
        auf Publikationslisten, die es in Wirklichkeit\\nnie gab; Plagiate. Das nicht
        hoch genug zu lobende Blog [Retraction\\nWatch](https://retractionwatch.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"} liefert dazu kontinuierlich neue F\xE4lle.\\n\\nAber in der
        letzten Zeit scheinen sich die Praktiken immer mehr\\nauszuweiten. Nicht nur
        von der eigentlichen Anzahl her, sondern auch von\\nden Praktiken und deren
        Grad an Professionalit\xE4t. Der Term \\\"Journal\\nHijacking\\\" kam zum
        Beispiel neu in unseren Wortschatz.\_ (vgl. Albakina,\\n2021) Der Ansatz bedeutet,
        dass jemand die Kopie eines\\nOpen-Access-Journals anlegt, welche nur eine
        ganz geringf\xFCgige\\nAbweichung zum Original hat \u2012 beispielsweise ein
        \\\"the\\\" vor dem\\nZeitschriftennamen \u2012, diese Kopie als das Original
        in den betreffenden\\nDatenbanken hinterlegt, um vom Ruf der Originalzeitschrift
        zu\\nprofitieren und dann gegen Zahlung von Artikelgeb\xFChren jeden\\neingereichten
        Artikel zu ver\xF6ffentlichen. (Im Kontext von hijacked\\njournal gibt es
        eine Reihe von Herausforderungen und Problemen; zu\\nHandlungsoptionen f\xFCr
        Verlage siehe Ryan (2024); zu Vorkommen von\\nPlagiaten in hijacked journals
        siehe Abalkina (2024).) Fast schon\\nnebenher haben wir in einigen Artikeln
        erfahren (zum Beispiel Singh\\nChawla (2024)), dass heute Zitationen genauso
        gekauft werden k\xF6nnen, wie\\nsonst Follower f\xFCr die verschiedenen Social-Media-Netzwerke.\_\\n\\nGleichzeitig
        lassen sich Texte, Daten und Bilder dank generativer\\nKI-Anwendungen noch
        schneller und einfacher f\xE4lschen, als zuvor (siehe\\nzum Beispiel Kendall,
        da Silva 2024; Sabel et al. 2023; Gu et al. 2022).\\nAndererseits findet sich
        auch die Erwartung, dass technische Anwendungen\\ngerade sehr gut geeignet
        sind, um Betrugsversuche zu entdecken (u.a.\\nFreedman ; Toni 2024). Eine
        \xDCbersicht zu mit ChatGPT generierten\\nwissenschaftlichen Aufs\xE4tzen
        gibt es zum Beispiel bei\\n[Retractionwatch](https://retractionwatch.com/papers-and-peer-reviews-with-evidence-of-chatgpt-writing/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer

        .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nF\xFCr die Ausgabe \\\\#47 der LIBREAS suchen wir
        nach Beitr\xE4gen, die sich in\\ndas Themenfeld Lug und Trug im Wissenschaftssystem
        wagen. Insbesondere\\nnach solchen, die auch danach fragen, was dies mit Bibliotheken
        zu tun\\nhat. Hat es zum Beispiel Einfluss auf die Arbeit von Bibliotheken
        im\\nFeld Informationskompetenz, Forschungsdatenmanagement oder \u2012\\ninsbesondere,
        wenn es um Artikel- oder Publikationsgeb\xFChren geht \u2012 Open\\nAccess?
        Sind Bibliotheken diesen Praktiken einfach ausgeliefert? Wenn\\nja, mit welchen
        Konsequenzen? Oder haben sie schon Gegenstrategien\\nentwickelt? Nicht zuletzt
        sind die Berichte zu Betrug im\\nWissenschaftssystem selbstverst\xE4ndlich
        nicht neu. Aber wie hat sich das\\nThema in den letzten Jahren, gar Jahrzehnten
        entwickelt? K\xF6nnen wir\\nvielleicht etwas aus fr\xFCheren \\\"Wellen\\\"
        an Betrug lernen?\\n\\nOder gibt es Erfahrungen oder Strategien zum Umgang
        mit Plagiaten\\nund/oder Plagiatssoftware beziehungsweise KI-generierten Haus-
        und\\nQualifikationsarbeiten im Bereich der Hochschullehre, die geteilt werden\\nm\xF6chten?\\n\\nInteressant
        wird auch sein, die Themen Bibliotheksethik und\\nInformationsethik wieder
        einmal neu anzugehen und zu fragen, ob\\nWertesysteme der neuen Situation

        \ \\n\\nEx Libris surprised us by suddenly [releasing Primo Research Assistant\\nto
        production on September 9,\\n2024\_](https://exlibrisgroup.com/announcement/ex-libris-primo-research-assistant-is-now-available-for-primo-institutions/)\_(when\\nthe
        earlier timeline was 4Q 2024 with some believing it might even be\\ndelayed).
        Despite the fact that there are so many [RAG (retrieval\\naugmented generation)
        academic search\\nsystems](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/p/list-of-academic-search-engines-that.html)\\ntoday
        that generate answers from search, this is still quite a\\nsignificant event
        to be worth covering in my blog.\\n\\nWhy? Simply put, while Primo Research
        Assistant may not break any new\\nground in terms of features or functionality,
        in all likelihood this\\nmight be the first academic search system that use
        RAG to generate\\nanswers that many librarians and users will encounter given
        the fact\\nthat Primo together with it\\\\'s cousin Summon (which will have
        it\\\\'s [own\\nResearch Assistant coming soon Q1\\n2025](https://exlibrisgroup.com/announcement/ex-libris-launches-a-beta-program-of-generative-ai-powered-primo-research-assistant/))\\nare
        two of the big 4 default academic search engines used by Academic\\nlibraries
        (the other two are Ebsco Discovery Service and WorldCat\\nDiscovery Service)
        and this feature is bundled in!\\n\\nI estimate this is 20% or so of academic
        libraries in US/UK/Canada etc\\n(likely higher for elite universities).\\n\\nAs
        such, here are some things you should know about Primo Research\\nAssistant
        (Primo RA) and my *first preliminary thoughts* (long). For\\nmore information
        on [Primo Research\\nAssistant.](https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Primo/Product_Documentation/020Primo_VE/Primo_VE_(English)/015_Getting_Started_with_Primo_Research_Assistant)\\n\\n
        \ \\n\\n### \\\\#1 Primo Research Assistant is bundled in with your current
        subscription {#primo-research-assistant-is-bundled-in-with-your-current-subscription
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"}\\n\\nUnlike AI offerings from Elsvier\\\\'s
        ([Scopus\\nAI](https://www.elsevier.com/products/scopus/scopus-ai)) or even\\nClarivate\\\\'s
        (parent of Ex libris) [Web of Science\\\\'s Research\\nAssistant](https://webofscience.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/25929584652561-Web-of-Science-Research-Assistant),\\nthere
        is no additional cost to libraries who already subscribe to Primo.\\n\\nIn
        fact, it is live right now in production, though you can (and\\nprobably should)
        turn it off.\\n\\nDo note as of time of this article, 15th September, librarians
        are\\nreporting that you can only hide the link to Primo Research assistant\\nfrom
        the Primo interface but if you know the link you can still access\\nit.\\n\\nThat
        said even if you do so it will require user authentication to\\naccess.\_\\n\\nIt\\\\'s
        somewhat hard to understand why Ex Libris chose to release this\\nwithout
        additional cost, given that unlike most software features the\\nmarginal cost
        to run RAG enabled searches are not zero due to LLM\\ninference costs and
        the potential users of Primo and Summon are likely\\nto be much larger than
        most academic search systems that currently\\nimplement this technology, but
        as you will see Ex Libris has taken care\\nto mitigate this issue by a) UI
        design and b) technology solutions\\n\\nDespite this, there has been suggestions
        (I forgot where I saw it, but\\nwas probably in a webinar) that Primo Research
        Assistant does have a\\nthreshold/throttle limit if your institution is sending
        too many queries\\nvia the Research Assistant and there might even be a premium
        service\\nadd-on in the future.\\n\\n###   {#section}\\n\\n### \\\\#2 By default
        your searches in Primo do not trigger the Primo Research Assistant {#by-default-your-searches-in-primo-do-not-trigger-the-primo-research-assistant}\\n\\n<div>\\n\\nEven
        if you do opt-in to turn on Primo Research assistant, the default\\nsearch
        does not trigger the Research Assistant to generate an answer.\\nThis is unlike
        other popular tools like Elicit.com, SciSpace etc but\\nsimilar to legacy
        databases like Scopus AI,\_[Statista\\nResearchAI](https://www.statista.com/research-ai/).\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n

        whole idea of RAG is that you search and find the top ranked\\ndocuments or
        text chunks and then feed them as \\\\\\\"context\\\\\\\" to a LLM to\\ntry
        to generate an answer to the question with intext citations. The\\nhope is
        that by grounding the answer in documents that are found, it\\nwill reduce
        hallucinations and allow you to check the source as opposed\\nto just asking
        a LLM directly.\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n  \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\nA simple RAG

        only cite what is found in a search, they do not\\nmake up fake papers unlike
        using a LLM alone. That said, they can\\n\\\\\\\"misinterprete\\\\\\\" the
        item that is cited. One technical term floating\\naround is citation faithfulness
        may be an issue. This is known to be\\nparticularly problematic when asking

        \ \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n**The Landscape: How AI is Shaping Discovery**\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n
        \ \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\nMy immediate reaction? Publishers
        who choose to opt out are shooting\\nthemselves in the foot, much like the
        initial wave of publishers who\\nrefused to be indexed in Google Scholar or
        early discovery indexes like\\nSummon, Primo, and EDS back in the early 2010s.
        Those who resisted\\neventually caved because being absent from these indexes
        meant losing\\ndiscoverability---and by extension, usage---while their competitors\\nbecame
        more visible.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n  \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\nAcademic
        libraries soon put these discovery services front and center as\\nthe default
        search boxes, driving all the traffic there. Publishers\\nquickly realized
        that being indexed meant a significant boost in COUNTER\\nstats, while those
        who weren't saw usage plummet. Google Scholar\\nindexing turned out to be
        even more critical, as everyone knows from\\ntheir traffic analysis.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n
        \ \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n### But It's Not Exactly the Same...\\n\\nEx
        Libris is being cautious with their CDI Research Assistant. It\\\\'s not\\nthe
        default, and a generated answer isn't produced for every search;\\nusers have
        to make a conscious effort to visit another site. So, the\\nimpact of being
        excluded here is less severe, at least for now.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\nThis
        approach mirrors how major products like Scopus AI and Statista are\\nhandling
        it. But if this feature becomes popular, it wouldn't be\\nsurprising if these
        systems switch to a default model where AI-generated\\nanswers, along with
        a list of relevant papers, are always shown---much\\nlike Elicit.com or SciSpace.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n
        \ \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\nIf we reach a point where AI-generated answers
        are the norm, choosing to\\nbe excluded could significantly hurt discoverability.
        The generated\\nanswer is highly prominent, and not being included there isn't
        great.\_\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n  \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n### The
        Case Against Inclusion\_ {#the-case-against-inclusion}\\n\\nOne could argue
        that if their content is cited in a RAG-generated\\nanswer, many users might
        not click through to the full text and instead\\nrely solely on the AI summary.
        This could lead to a drop in usage stats,\\nprompting librarians to consider
        canceling the subscription. This\\nconcern echoes the frustrations some web
        owners have with Google's\\nKnowledge Graph and featured snippets, which they
        believe steal content\\nbecause users no longer click through to the source.\\n\\nBut
        how strong is this argument? It depends on your view of user\\nbehavior.\\n\\nTo
        make this argument work, users would need to be a specific type of\\nlazy---lazy
        enough to rely on an AI-generated summary if it's there, but\\ndiligent enough
        to click through to the full text if it's not.\\n\\nStill despite my analysis,
        we can see more content owners choosing to be\\nexcluded. [Since my last blog
        post on\\nthis](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2024/08/ai-retrieval-augmented-generation.html),\\nElsevier,
        the first of the \\\\\\\"big 5\\\\\\\" publishers has joined in! In a\\nsense
        this isn\\\\'t surprising, since Elsevier has always been protective\\nof
        their content (e.g[. they were the last of the big 5 publishers and\\none

        have the rights)\\nand espically DataCite (I guess they are just a DOI registration

        effective are research assessment reform initiatives in mobilizing\\ncollective
        action? Framework and case studies of DORA and CoARA\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n***Alex
        Rushforth**\_and Gunnar Sivertsen*\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nRecent years have
        seen considerable growth of reform movements aiming to\\narrest perceived
        dysfunctions across science. A prominent problem that\\nhas formed the focus
        of activism in academia has been research\\nassessment practices. Multi-actor
        initiatives such as the Declaration on\\nResearch Assessment (DORA) and the
        Coalition on Advancing Research\\nAssessment (CoARA) have served as prominent
        backbone organizations for\\nthis movement, coordinating collective action
        among diverse research\\nstakeholders. As governance structures within science,
        a notable\\ncharacteristic is their reliance upon 'soft governance' and 'self\\nregulation',
        rather than incentives or coercion. In this paper we take\\nstock of how effective
        these example initiatives have been in\\ncoordinating and mobilizing collective
        action on their respective\\nproblems. We introduce a framework to compare
        the initiatives, apply it\\nto these two cases, and draw conclusions about
        the respective\\nachievements, challenges, and limitations of these structures.\\n\\nThe
        inventive spill-over of corporate publications\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n*Antoine
        Schoen, Patricia Laurens, Gaston Heimeriks, Martina\\nNeul\xE4ndtner, Thomas
        Scherngell, **Alfredo Yegros**, and Philippe Lar\xE9do*\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nThis
        paper looks at how scientific collaboration linking universities\\nand large
        international firms fosters local invention. The first step\\naims at identifying
        the universities engaged in collaboration with large\\ncorporate entities
        belonging to the industrial sectors of\\npharmaceuticals, chemicals and biotechnology.
        After having identified\\nthe corpus of corporate publications authored by
        these enterprises we\\nanalyse in this corpus the universities engaged in
        this corporate\\nscientific collaboration allocating the co-authoring institutions
        in the\\nterritories hosting the academic authors. The extent and nature of
        the\\nuniversities' collaboration with large firms is then analysed using
        the\\nSAR model in regard to the intensity of local inventive intensity in
        the\\nmetropolitan area hosting the universities. The results show that\\ncorporate
        publications have a clear and significant effect on inventive\\noutcome and
        production.\\n\\nIncentivizing, excluding, and enduring: On the complexities
        of\\nquantitative research assessment in Lithuania\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n***Eleonora
        Dagiene**, Vincent Larivi\xE8re, and **Ludo Waltman***\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nLithuania's
        research assessment prioritises Web of Science publications,\\naiming for
        international impact. This paper examines the policy,\\nintroduced in 2012,
        of excluding articles from journals with low impact\\nfactor or suspected
        citation inflation. We analyse how this suspension\\npolicy affected domestic
        journals and researchers' behaviour. The\\nresults show that Lithuanian researchers'
        publications in foreign\\noutlets increased, but concerns remain about the
        chosen outlets' quality\\nand potential continuing manipulation of Web of
        Science metrics. These\\nare initial findings of a broader study exploring
        policy dynamics and\\nunexpected consequences of quantitative research assessment.\\n\\nDoes
        mobility help to build bridge of collaboration between origin and\\ndestination
        country\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n***Huilin Ge**, **Clara Calero Medina**, and
        **Rodrigo Costas***\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nAcademic mobility is a phenomenon
        in today's academic landscape that\\nfacilitates global collaboration and
        knowledge transfer. Despite the\\nbenefits of academic mobility, concerns
        about brain drain persist, and\\nfears of inequalities in mobility dynamics
        start to emerge. Our research\\nexplores the relationship between mobile researchers
        and the\\ncollaboration ties with their country of origin, revealing a remarkable\\ntrend:
        mobile academics maintain varying degrees of collaboration with\\ntheir origin
        countries after moving. Scholars migrating from\\nhigher-income countries
        to lower-income ones exhibit a strong\\ninclination to maintain ties with
        their highincome origins, but the\\nreverse is not observed. These findings
        suggest unequal benefits of\\nmobility regarding the collaboration ties and
        highlight the necessity\\nfor implementing policies and initiatives geared
        towards nurturing more\\nbeneficial international research collaboration and
        harnessing the\\ncontributions of mobile scientists.\\n\\nFunding flows in
        Africa according to Dimensions grant data\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n***Jonathan
        Dudek**, **Jeroen van Honk**, Isabel Basson, **Carole de\\nBordes**, **Ismael
        Rafols**, and **Rodrigo Costas***\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nMost African countries
        have low domestic research funding and receive a\\nsignificant portion of
        their funding from foreign sources. Consequently,\\nit is of special interest
        to understand funding flows and their\\ninfluence on African research. The
        Dimensions (Digital Science) database\\nbrings together information from publications
        and projects funded by\\nmore than 500 funding agencies from more than 40
        countries. By combining\\ngrant (project) data and funding acknowledgments
        in publications, we\\nanalyse funding flows to African countries: who are
        the main funders?\\nwhich countries and organizations do they support? what
        issues do they\\nprioritize? The study will also explore the possibilities
        and\\nlimitations of using Dimensions funding-related data for the analysis
        of\\nfunding flows between global regions.\\n\\nTaming complexity: narrative
        CVs in grant funding evaluations\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n***Judit Varga**,
        **Wolfgang Kaltenbrunner**, and Helen Buckley Woods*\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nThis
        short paper presents preliminary findings from a research project\\ninvestigating
        the uptake and use of so-called narrative CVs in review\\npanels for research
        funding decisions. Our analysis draws on empirical\\nmaterial collected through
        interviews and participant observation in two\\nsubsequent panel meetings
        of a funding program for early career\\nresearchers of the Dutch national
        research council NWO. As expected, we\\nfind that the recent introduction
        of a narrative CV in this program has\\nnot instantaneously transformed evaluative
        practices. Rather, the\\nemphasis on substantive narrative accounts of applicants'
        achievements,\\ncombined with the backgrounding of quantifiable evidence such
        as\\npublication counts and metrics, leads reviewers to gradually\\nproblematize
        and reconsider previously dominant definitions of quality.\\nOur analysis
        showcases exemplary situations in which such reflection\\nbecomes apparent,
        and it highlights different ways in which reviewers\\ntry to resolve newly
        underdetermined evaluative situations.\\n\\nGeography in Scientific Practice
        and Country Biases\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n***Leyan Wu**, Akrati Saxena, and
        **Vincent Traag***\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nRecent decades witnessed a steady
        increase in international scientific\\ncollaboration, alongside debates on
        nationalist tendencies in scientific\\npractices and global disparities in
        citation flows. Geographical\\nproximity has been shown to influence collaboration
        and citation rates,\\nyet how this affects global patterns remains unclear.
        Addressing this\\ngap, we examine the interplay of geography and country-level
        effects in\\ncollaboration and citations using OpenAlex data. Analysing 1.6
        million\\npublications with 6.8 million collaborations, and 3.7 million citations,\\nwe
        unveil distinct distance dependencies and country-level effects.\\nCollaborations
        between countries decline slower with distance compared\\nto intra-country
        collaborations. Surprisingly, citations between\\ncountries display lower
        distance dependence above a certain threshold,\\nwhile intra-country citations
        decrease notably. These findings suggest\\nthat geographical factors alone
        do not determine inter-country\\ncollaborations and citations, hinting at
        underlying country-level\\neffects that we will explore further in follow-up
        research. This study\\nadvances our understanding of the complex dynamics
        shaping international\\nscientific engagement.\\n\\nThe use of non-institutional
        email addresses in retracted publications\\nwith special attention to mass
        retractions due to fraudulent peer review\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n***Marc Luwel**\_and
        **Nees Jan van Eck***\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nThe explosion of cases of peer
        review fraud and activities of paper\\nmills pose a systemic threat to the
        integrity of the scientific\\npublishing process. By linking the Retraction
        Watch and Web of Science\\ndatabases, metadata of retracted publications are
        analysed. In the\\nperiod 2007-2021, the use of non-institutional email addresses
        by these\\npublications' reprint authors increased by more than 20%, mainly
        due to\\nan even larger increase from authors with a postal address in India
        and\\nespecially China. Among the journals with the most retracted\\npublications,
        the use of non-institutional email addresses by reprint\\nauthors differs
        greatly: from 7 to 99%. It is also surprising that only\\n36% of the mainly
        Chinese reprint authors of the mass retracted\\npublications in Hindawi journals
        used a non-institutional email address.\\nThese results indicate that caution
        is recommended and not to\\nautomatically red-flag publications as fraudulent
        when non-institutional\\nemail addresses are used.\\n\\nDifferent representations
        of forest science in bibliographic databases\\nand the (in-)visibility of
        Tanzanian research: applying an epistemic\\n(in-)justice lens\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n*Nelius
        Boshoff, Similo Ngwenya, Amani J. Uisso, Susanne Koch, **Rodrigo\\nCostas**,
        and **Jonathan Dudek***\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nInspired by a search for epistemic
        justice, the study examines the\\nrepresentation of Tanzanian forest science
        in five databases:\\nDimensions, OpenAlex, Scopus, Web of Science and a manually
        compiled set\\nof articles in Tanzanian journals. It also ascertains whether
        profiles\\nof three epistemic elements (alignment of research to national
        research\\npriorities, national region studied, and forest type studied) differ\\nbetween
        the databases. Initial findings of the ongoing research indicate\\nthat OpenAlex
        has the highest coverage of Tanzanian forest science\\narticles and that it
        incorporates all the forest science articles of the\\nother databases (excluding
        those in the Tanzanian dataset). In fact, 87%\\nof articles in Tanzanian journals
        do not appear in the other databases'\\nforest science collections. This is
        a form of epistemic injustice as the\\ninvisibility of large parts of forest
        science produced by Tanzanian\\nauthors collectively marginalises them and
        ultimately prevents them from\\nfully participating in scientific meaning-making.\\n\\nCoverage
        and metadata availability of African publications in OpenAlex:\\na comparative
        analysis\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n*Patricia Alonso-\xC1lvarez and **Nees Jan
        van Eck***\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nUnlike traditional proprietary data sources
        like Scopus and the Web of\\nScience (WoS), OpenAlex emphasises its comprehensiveness,
        claiming an\\nextra coverage of humanities, non-English languages, and the
        Global\\nSouth. Strengthening diversity and inclusivity in science is crucial
        for\\nethical and practical reasons. This paper analyses OpenAlex's coverage\\nand
        metadata availability of African-based publications. For this\\npurpose, OpenAlex
        is compared with Scopus, WoS, and African Journals\\nOnline (AJOL). We first
        compare the coverage of African publications in\\nOpenAlex against that of
        WoS, Scopus, and AJOL. We then assess and\\ncompare the available metadata
        for OpenAlex, Scopus, and WoS\\npublications. The analysis shows that OpenAlex
        offers the most extensive\\npublication coverage. Regarding metadata, OpenAlex
        offers a high\\ncoverage of publication and author information. It performs
        worse\\nregarding affiliations, references, and funder information. Importantly,\\nthe
        results also show that metadata availability in OpenAlex is better\\nfor publications
        also indexed in Scopus and WoS.\\n\\nUnexpected consequences of Dutch Open
        Science policy. The effects on\\nDutch scholarly publishing\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n***Thed
        van Leeuwen**, Lieuwe Kool, and Ingrid Wijk*\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nIn this
        study we aim at some unintended consequences of science policy\\nregarding
        open access publishing by Dutch academics. Various actors in\\nthe system
        have advocated different forms of open access publishing, and\\nour study
        will unravel how publishing occurs in various forms of open\\naccess publishing
        (Gold versus Hybrid), and for two types of scholarly\\npublishing, the general
        output of the Netherlands and the output for\\nwhich authors located in the
        Netherlands are corresponding authors. A\\nspecial focus will be on any underlying
        field differences across the\\nDutch scholarly landscape. The study shows
        that contrary to national and\\ninternational efforts, the main focus of Dutch
        academics is on Hybrid\\nopen access publishing.\\n\\nHow does SDG Related
        Research Differ?\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n*Tommaso Ciarli, Hugo Confraria, **Ed
        Noyons**, and **Ismael Rafols***\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nThis paper examines
        the characteristics and impact of research related\\nto the Sustainable Development
        Goals (SDGs), aiming to understand\\nspecific features of SDG-related research
        compared to non- SDG related\\nresearch. The findings reveal that SDG-research
        research, especially on\\nSDGs related to people and society (such as poverty
        alleviation,\\neducation, gender equality, and justice) are more likely to
        be cited in\\npolicy documents, indicating their relevance for public use,
        and to\\nadopt features of open science, such as open access and\\ninterdisciplinary.
        However, these publications are less likely to\\nmention funding and are less
        likely to be cited in academic publications\\ncompared to non-SDG-related
        research, suggesting a disconnect between\\npotentially more impactful research
        and academic recognition. Results\\nreveal gaps in research funding priorities
        while emphasising the\\nimportance of considering the societal relevance of
        research alongside\\ntraditional excellence criteria.\\n\\n### Poster presentations\\n\\nUtilising

        it to that of their home and\\nhost countries' counterparts. We contextualized
        CSC awardees'\\nperformance benchmarking against their home and host countries'\\ncounterparts,
        by using normalized mean citation score (MNCS) and the\\nproportion of highly
        cited papers (PP(top 10%)) and the proportion of\\nopen access papers (PP_OA).
        Our work reveals CSC-funded papers overall\\nconsistently demonstrate superior
        scientific research and open access\\nperformance compared to Chinese researchers
        of the same period.\\nAdditionally, within Physical Sciences and Engineering
        and Mathematics &\\nComputer Science, CSC awardees exceled than their hosting
        countries with\\nhigh MNCS and PP (top 10%), but in some countries CSC awardees
        (e.g. the\\nUS, Canada, Australia et al) have lower open access rates. Conversely,\\nin
        Biomedical and Health Sciences, CSC awardees show inferior\\nperformance but

        study presents the overview of Chinese scholars' international\\nmobility
        based on bibliometrics data from Dimension. We identify\\n2,446,785 individual
        researchers affiliated with China from the\\n2000-2022 period. Based on those
        data, we find that 2,381,665\\nresearchers are not moving in their academic
        careers, and 65,120\\nresearchers have international mobile footprints. Furthermore,
        after\\ndistinguishing China as an origin country and destination country,
        we\\nfind that China has been losing researchers since 2000, with the United\\nStates
        being the main destination for those who move internationally.\\nWhat's more,
        we find that when scholars move, they generally do not\\nchange their research
        fields on a large scale, but some do change their\\nfields, particularly in
        the social sciences. Our study illustrates the\\nlandscape of Chinese researchers'
        international mobility and highlights\\nthe flow patterns.\\n\\nConnecting

        peer review in STI research\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n***Wolfgang Kaltenbrunner**,
        Felicitas Hesselmann, Serge Horbach*\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nWhile a lot of
        STI research focuses on innovations in scholarly\\npublishing as a research
        object, our own scholarly communication\\npractices often rely on more traditional
        (closed) journal - based pre -\\npublication peer review. In this special
        session, we aim to discuss to\\nwhat extent this is an intentional choice,
        and in what ways we might\\nbenefit from the various affordances of open peer
        review - in particular\\nthe prospect of reusing open review reports across
        various outlets or\\ncontexts. The discussion will be prepared by four short
        pitches. First,\\nsome of the organiz ers of the preceding STI conference
        will report\\nabout experiences with open peer review in the 2023 STI iteration
        in\\nLeiden (Ludo Waltman). A second pitch will collect the existing evidence\\non
        implications of open peer review for diversity and participatio n\\n(Serge
        Horbach). A third pitch will reflect what open and portable\\nreview reports
        mean for the workings of the peer review economy in a\\npublishing context
        (Wolfgang Kaltenbrunner). Finally, there will be a\\npitch on the possibilities
        of automation in peer review and its\\nimplications for openness (Felicitas
        Hesselmann).\\n\\nThe subsequent discussion will focus on the following questions:\\n\\n-
        What are STI attendants' motivations to (not) engage in open review\\n  formats?\\n-
        What are the most important opportunities and challenges related to\\n  implementing
        open and portable peer reviews?\\n- How do open and portable reviews alter
        the development of research\\n  arguments and the engagement with audiences?\\n-
        How compatible are various publication cultures with open reviews?\\n\\nIn

        the past five years, the reform movements for open science and\\nresearch
        assessment have expanded significantly. Increasingly, their\\nagendas overlap
        , with champions of open science seeing current\\nassessment practices as
        incentivizing behaviours that hinder wider\\naccommodation of open science
        activities among researchers (UNESCO,\\n2021, Nosek, 2019, Spector, 2022)
        . Reform of academic career assessment\\nsystems is often earmarked as a site
        through which to incentivize\\nacademics to more fully embrace open ways of
        working (e.g. EC, 2017,\\nMustajoki et al., 2021, Pietil\xE4 et al., 2023,
        M\xE9ndez and S\xE1nchez -\\nN\xFA\xF1ez, 2023) . It is of course easy to
        say that researchers in general\\nshould be 'recognized' and 'rewarded' for
        open science (in its various\\nincarnations) . But what might this look like
        in practice, what has\\nactually been tried out so far, how might researchers
        in their roles as\\nevaluators and producers of knowledge respond to such
        steering efforts,\\nand what might be the consequences for career evaluations
        and research\\npractices in different research fields and academic institutional\\nsettings?\\n\\nThis
        special session brings together a range of science studies\\nresearchers and
        practitioners working on the emerging intersections\\nbetween open science
        and academic career research assessment reforms ,\\nto present, discuss, and
        debate current and future practices . Each\\nspeaker will be invited to reflect
        upon the promises, achievements, and\\nchallenges faced in turning this broad
        promise into workable practices.\\n\\nThe state of open research information-

        community in open\\nresearch information (ORI), that is, scientometric data
        sources that are\\nopen. Data in these sources can be freely accessed and
        shared. Examples\\nof open data sources include global multidisciplinary infrastructures\\n(e.g.

        an overview of the current\\nstate and potential futures of the landscape
        of open research\\ninformation. This will include the quality (e.g., accuracy
        and\\ncompleteness) of the data available from open scientometric data\\nsources,
        the use and adoption of open scientometric data sources, and\\ndevelopments
        regarding governance, cooperation, and sustainability of\\nopen scientometric
        data source. To get started, there will be four\\nfive - minut e talks aimed
        at offering a diversity of perspectives on\\nthe state of the open research

        Abstract\\n\\nOver the past decade, there has been a significant increase
        in the\\nnumber of bibliometric analyses published in the peer - reviewed\\nliterature,
        particularly outside of library and information science\\nwhere bibliometric
        s is traditionally situated. While diversity has\\nalways been a strength,
        it also poses challenges in ensuring quality.\\nThe variability in reporting
        quality we currently see may, at least\\npartially, be grounded in the lack
        of guidance on how to conduct and\\nreport bibliometric studies by experts
        from within the field. This\\nspecial session will engage the community in
        a discussion about quality\\nand reporting of bibliometric analyses. Our session
        relates to the\\nconference theme of \\\"Into the great wide open?\\\" in
        that the level of\\nopenness in the bibliometrics community -- our methods
        and analytical\\ntools, the application of our work, our disciplinary backgrounds,
        and\\nincreasingly more often our data sources -- have given rise to a\\nchallenge
        in ensuring the quality of our work and the integrity of the\\nfield. The
        session will combine an introductory panel and an open\\nfishbowl conversation.
        Five chairs will be arranged in the center of the\\nroom, four of which will
        be occupied initially by our panellists . A\\nfifth chair will be left empty
        for audience members to participate in\\nthe conversation , forcing a panellist
        to leave the fishbowl and invite\\na dynamic discussion. This session will
        be an opportunity for\\nparticipants to provide their input and discuss current
        issues in the\\ncontext of open science with a focus on transparency and\\nreproducibility,

        trans-national reform movement for responsible research assessment\\nis growing
        considerably. As part of this, there is increasing interest\\nin monitoring
        and evaluating research cultures and environments (RCE)\\nwithin national,
        program and institutional assessment processes. Moving\\nfrom broad aspirations
        to workable, transparent and legitimate\\nevaluation practices is not however
        straightforward. Meeting these\\ndemands will necessitate relevant, trusted
        and reliable indicators, that\\ncan provide the robustness of evidence needed
        for monitoring and\\nevaluation. Rapidly unfolding developments around RCE
        indicators thus\\nmerit urgent attention from experts within the STI community.
        The aim of\\nthis special session is to bring together researchers and practitioners\\nto
        debate urgent questions over emerging RCE indicators, draw out\\nimportant
        lessons, and compare experiences a cross research systems.\\n\\nThe format
        will consist of short presentations from invited experts from\\nthe Research

        out technical and social issues RCE\\ndevelopments are throwing up. These
        include methodological questions\\nover indicator design and data needs, potential

        \ \\nIn its proposal for a new strategy, \\\\\\\"Towards responsible publishing\\\\\\\"
        ,\\ncOAlition S summarizes: \\\"In the five years that have elapsed since
        the\\npublication of the Plan S principles, the move toward full and immediate\\nOpen
        Access (OA) has become global and irreversible.\\\" However, \\\"this has\\nbeen
        delivered through business models -- such as Read and Publish\\nagreements
        and APCs -- which are highly inequitable\\\". The coalition now\\nenvisages
        a \\\"scholar-led\\\" and \\\"community-based\\\" scholarly communication\\nsystem
        \\\"without author-facing charges\\\". Furthermore, the general OA\\nambition
        of Plan S is \\\"extended to include all scholarly outputs, such\\nas preprints
        and peer review reports\\\" because \\\"the current practice of\\npre-publication
        peer review needlessly delays the sharing of research\\noutputs\\\".\\n\\n*Session
        Goals*  \\nThe aim of the session is to discuss the new focuses and priorities
        of\\nCoalition S based on experiences so far -- including evidence provided\\nby
        the areas of research contributing to the STI conferences. Three\\ntopics
        will be prepared for short introductions to start discussions\\nwith the audience:\\n\\n1.
        \ Empirical examination of the OA transformation so far: The\\n    discussion
        will focus on the empirical evidence pertaining to the\\n    transition into
        Open Access publishing in recent years. A core\\n    question will be how
        the transition aligns with the traditional\\n    research policy criteria
        of research quality and affordability.\\n2.  Challenges with changing the
        market of scientific publishing: The\\n    discussion will focus on new initiatives
        for scholarly publishing,\\n    their foundation and implementation issues,
        in particular the vision\\n    of a \\\"scholar-led\\\" and \\\"community-based\\\"
        scholarly communication\\n    system \\\"without author-facing charges\\\".
        To what degree are the\\n    trends in the present market of scientific publishing
        aligned with\\n    these principles, and how can they be fully aligned?\\n3.
        \ Exploration of change trajectories for editorial practices: What are\\n
        \   the experiences so far with alternatives to pre-publication peer\\n    review,
        and how do they align with the plurality of existing\\n    community-based

        rapidly evolving social landscape, which encompasses\\ncritical issues such
        as climate change, poverty, and technological\\nadvancements, the intersection
        of policy and science holds paramount\\nsignificance. Understanding how research
        informs and shapes policy\\ndecisions has become increasingly crucial, sparking
        discussions on\\nmethodologies for assessing impact. While tools like Overton
        and\\nAltmetric.com have gained popularity, they do not provide neither enough\\ncoverture,
        nor open data, presenting two significant challenges:\\nestablishing open
        - access sources for policy documents and bridging the\\ncoverage gaps between
        the Global South and the Global North. The special\\nsession aims to address
        two specific interests: (i) exploring the\\ndifferences and synergies between
        open and proprietary data sources of\\npolicy documents, and (ii) examining
        the disparities in coverage between\\nthe Global South and Global North regarding
        policy documents and related\\nscholarly outputs within these data sources.
        The proposal aims to foster\\ndebate on potential methodologies for leveraging
        open sources of policy\\ndocuments and for identifying and analyzing inequalities
        in accessing\\nresearch impact on policy. Furthermore, the session seeks to
        explore\\nstrategies for overcoming these inequalities and enhancing the\\nsignificance
        of open data sources in the process.\\n\\nThe session\\\\'s dynamics will
        involve brief speeches from invited guests,\\napproximately 10 minutes each,
        forming a debate panel. Audience\\nparticipation will be encouraged through
        commenting or making questions\\non the topic.\\n\\n### GLOBAL consensus\_meeting\\n\\n[Right

        as of May 5,\\n2024.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nBelow, the website reads:\\n\\n>
        While so many CiBNP students who learn to write scientific articles\\n> successfully
        write great articles, there still are some students who\\n> would make mistakes,
        and unintentional errors.\\n>\\n> While we teach them research methodology
        and writing, and look after\\n> their writing style and rules and methodology,
        we do know that in\\n> order to get a fast publication some students may produce
        low quality\\n> papers. Therefore, if you come across papers written by our
        students\\n> and find mistakes and errors, rather than laughing, mocking,
        or making\\n> fun of them or criticizing them, please respectfully point out
        the\\n> mistakes so the author can learn and write an improved version of\\n>
        article in the future.\\n>\\n> Our students are young doctors, and your mocking
        and criticism can\\n> destroy their confidence and self-esteem and they may
        give up and stop\\n> writing in the future.\\n>\\n> Many of our students don't
        produce highest quality of articles but we\\n> still appreciate our students
        and love them unconditionally.\\n>\\n> We teach our students honesty, and
        integrity, and educate them about\\n> the importance of truth and honesty.
        Yet it is also possible that any\\n> of our students lies or fabricates data
        in the paper deliberately.\\n> Therefore, we CiBNP hold no responsibility
        of the content of the\\n> article produced. We teach the students the importance
        of honesty and\\n> integrity and if they still don't listen to us and make
        intentional\\n> mistakes or fabricate the data, and submit to a journal and\\n>
        accidentally the journal reviewers missed the mistakes and journal\\n> publishes
        that article, then the student is himself/herself\\n> responsible.\\n>\\n>
        Just like a medical school that trains students to become doctors and\\n>
        if the same student becomes a corrupt doctor or harms the patient\\n> deliberately
        or unintentionally, is the medical school responsible?\\n> Similarly, when
        a building or a bridge collapses due to bad\\n> calculations by the civil
        engineers, should we hold the engineering\\n> university responsible? The
        obvious answer is NO.\\n>\\n> Similarly, if our students who learned the skill
        of writing and make\\n> deliberate mistakes or are involved in scientific
        fraud or fabrication\\n> of data, should we be responsible? For this reason
        we don't take\\n> responsibility of the scientific content and our students
        sign an\\n> agreement and agree that they are fully responsible for the content.\\n>
        CiBNP and its faculty can only teach and guide but are not responsible\\n>
        for the content, fabrication, or deception or lies of any kind, the\\n> content
        is solely Students' responsibility.\\n\\nAs you might guess from this disclaimer
        absolving CIBNP from any of its\\nstudent's errors or misconduct, the publications
        produced by these\\ntraining programs are often not very good. I've included
        an updating\\nlist of select PubPeer threads for articles originating from
        these\\nbusinesses at the bottom of this post.\\n\\nThe global landscape of
        medical training is exceptionally unequal and\\nhyper-competitive. Within
        this system, dozens of businesses have emerged\\nto prey on aspiring doctors
        from the Global South, litter the medical\\nliterature with low-quality and
        fraudulent studies, and throw these\\ndoctors under the bus when the backlash
        begins. While some of these\\nbusinesses may have helped a handful of doctors
        to surmount the high\\nwalls surrounding the United States medical system,
        the for-profit\\nnature of these businesses ensures this privilege is only
        available to\\nthose that can pay, perpetuating the same inequality that these\\nbusinesses
        claim to fight. CIBNP is right; the victims of these\\nbusinesses deserve
        our compassion, not our scorn.\\n\\nAs long as global economies of scientific
        and medical research remain\\nhighly stratified and cutthroat, paper mills
        will continue to\\nmaterialize to exploit these ills and the people most vulnerable
        to\\nthem.\\n\\n#### Selected publications from IMG-targeting paper mills

        Image\\nLibrary.</a></em></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nBecause cell lines
        can grow indefinitely, one research laboratory or\\nlaboratory supplier can
        take a few cells from their cell line stock and\\ngive them to another laboratory
        for that laboratory to begin culturing\\ntheir own stock. By far the most
        popular cell line is\\n[HeLa](https://www.cellosaurus.org/CVCL_0030), and
        the many of thousands\\nof HeLa cell stocks used in biomedical research around
        the world can all\\nbe traced back to the original stock of \\\"immortal\\\"
        cervical cancer cells\\ntaken from [Henrietta Lacks in\\n1951](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Lacks).\\n\\nOne
        complication of relying on cell lines for biomedical research is\\nthat stocks
        will often become cross-contaminated by other cell lines.\\nFor instance,
        HeLa is extremely aggressive as cancer cell lines go and\\nHeLa cells will
        easily overtake other cell line stocks that are stored\\nnearby. The popular
        gastric cancer cell line\\n[BGC-823](https://www.cellosaurus.org/CVCL_3360)
        is one such victim of\\nHeLa's aggression; there are no remaining uncontaminated
        stocks of\\nBGC-823 and thus it is no longer considered an appropriate experimental\\nmodel
        for gastric cancer. The International Cell Line Authentication\\nCommittee
        maintains [a register of misidentified cell\\nlines](https://iclac.org/databases/cross-contaminations/)
        that is\\ncurrently 582 entries long. A good number of these cell lines were\\ncontaminated
        by cells from a completely different organism, such as\\nhuman salivary gland
        cell line\\n[CAC2](https://www.cellosaurus.org/CVCL_6883), which is actually
        made up\\nof unknown cells from a rat.\\n\\nBecause [different cell lines
        can have a wide variety of responses to\\nthe same\\ntreatment](https://www.cancerrxgene.org/compound/Paclitaxel/11/overview/ic50),\\nit
        is essential that researchers avoid misidentified cell lines and only\\nwork
        with authenticated cell lines that actually represent their system\\nof interest.\\n\\n<figure

        of\\nCancer*](https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.34995), we can now report on a\\nwhole
        new threat to biomedical research: cell lines that never existed\\nin the
        first place.\\n\\nThe names of cell lines are usually just a jumble of letters
        and numbers\\nand thus can often be easily confused. For instance, the name
        of BGC-823\\nis very similar to that of\\n[MGC-803](https://www.cellosaurus.org/CVCL_5334),
        another misidentified\\ngastric cancer cell line. One might easily misspell
        these cell lines as\\n\\\"BGC-803\\\" or \\\"MGC-823\\\". However, we noticed
        that sometimes these\\nmisspelled identifiers were used to refer to another
        cell line entirely\\ndistinct from these existing cell lines. Take the 2021
        article [\\\"Long\\nnon-coding RNA KCNQ1OT1 promotes the progression of gastric
        cancer via\\nthe miR-145-5p/ARF6 axis\\\"](https://doi.org/10.1002/jgm.3330)

        effects and therapeutic applications of herbs and\\nspices. Aggarwal was particularly
        drawn to curcumin, a non-toxic\\ncompound found in turmeric that has long
        been staple in Ayurvedic\\nsystems of medicine. He authored more than 120
        articles about the\\ncompound from 1994 to 2020. These articles reported that

        The Papermill Alarm has grown to become a comprehensive mix\\nof methods for
        detecting organised research fraud and simplifying a\\ncomplex problem. But
        there's something new. Something bigger and better\\nfrom Clear\_Skies.\\n\\nDo
        you know what an \\\"SEP field\\\" is? It's from Douglas\_Adams:\\n\\n> An
        SEP is something we can't see, or don't see, or our brain doesn't\\n> let
        us see, because we think that it's somebody else's problem. That's\\n> what
        SEP means. Somebody Else's Problem. The brain just edits it out,\\n> it's
        like a blind\_spot.\\n\\nI used to think the \\\"SEP field\\\"\u200A---\u200Aa
        fictional tool for making\\nsomething invisible\u200A---\u200Awas a just a
        joke, but the more I think about it\\nthe more I think it's a real\_thing.\\n\\nI'd
        spent a chunk of COVID lockdown working out a scalable solution to\\nthe papermill
        detection problem. Papermills were a small part of what I\\nwanted to do with
        Clear Skies, but it was already clear to me at that\\ntime that this was going
        to be a big project. I made this solution into\\nan API (called \\\"Papermill
        Alarm\\\" available via RapidAPI) allowing\\npublishers to self-serve and
        screen their submissions for problematic\\ncontent. The Papermill Alarm was
        the first commercial service\\n*dedicated* to papermill detection (but it's
        probably worth mentioning\\nthat it wasn't the first papermill detector that
        we released\u200A---\u200A[that\\nwas the duplicate submission check in the
        Clear Skies Article\\nTracker](https://medium.com/@clearskiesadam/how-to-find-all-the-papermills-step-1-f00c624facb1)).\\n\\nSome
        publishers were quick to hop onto the API and start using it. By\\nand large,
        it was used responsibly and it felt great to know that the\\nservice was helping
        people. Sadly, there was a small amount of abuse of\\nthat service by papermills
        (and even by one publisher), so the free\\nversion was short-lived, but I
        think it showed that papermill detection\\nwas a tractable problem.\\n\\nThe
        whole time, there was something in the back of my\_mind.\\n\\nIt must have
        been at least a decade ago. I was editing a journal and I\\nsaw a referee
        make the best catch I've ever seen. A manuscript was sent\\nto him for review
        and he responded with a copy of a published paper\\nwritten in his native
        language. He pointed out\_that\\n\\n- the published paper was identical to
        the manuscript I'd sent him\\n  except the one I had sent him had been translated
        to English\_and\\n- the original, which had been published some time previously,
        had\\n  different author names on\_it.\\n- So it looked like someone had simply
        translated a paper, put their own\\n  name on it and sent it off for review
        hoping to get a paper published\\n  without actually doing any research.\\n\\nIt
        was really odd, but the team handled it like your typical plagiarism\\ncase.
        The matter was investigated, the manuscript was rejected, and the\\nauthors
        were warned off repeat behaviour.\\n\\nEven after it was all finished, something
        was bothering me, but it went\\nto the back of my\_mind.\\n\\nHop forward
        to late-2022 and it was clear that there was demand for the\\nPapermill Alarm,
        but that early version needed to\_develop.\\n\\n[I've always viewed misconduct
        detection as a network analysis\\nproblem](https://medium.com/@clearskiesadam/papermills-in-peer-review-c507b12aa4ac).\\nIndeed,
        it turns out that network analysis is the primary analytical\\nmethod employed
        for fraud detection in other industries, too.\\n\\nOne method that was in
        constant development from shortly after the\\nPapermill Alarm's initial release
        was 'Keystone'. [That was about\\nfinding the individuals most-connected to
        research\\nfraud](https://medium.com/@clearskiesadam/keystone-papermill-detection-with-network-analysis-3a48de927406).\\nThe
        choice of name isn't an accident. The keystone in a building is\\nusually
        the one that holds it all together\u200A---\u200Aif you remove a brick\\nfrom
        a structure, it will probably be ok, but remove the keystone and it\\nall
        falls down. I think that these individuals are structurally\\nimportant to
        the networks of bad actors that perpetuate research fraud.\\nIf we're going
        to point limited resources at investigations we should\\ntarget the dealers,
        not the users. So this shows where we\\nmight\_focus\_our\_efforts.\\n\\nBy
        early 2023, misconduct detection was clearly in-vogue. So we expanded\\nthe
        tool to cover all areas of science as well as adding new detection\\npipelines
        and an introductory version (called \\\"Papermill Alarm: Public\\\")\\nfor
        cases where data was limited.\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nThen I heard a story. An
        author had submitted a paper to a journal, only\\nto be accused of plagiarism.
        The journal had already received an\\nidentical paper with different authorship.\\n\\nBut
        the author protested and insisted that the paper was their own\\noriginal
        work. They hadn't shared it, *but they had written the work in\\ntheir native
        language, and then sent it to a translation company to be\\ntranslated to
        English.* So it seemed that the paper had been translated\\nby the translation
        company and that the translation company had then\\nsold the manuscript to
        different 'authors' before the real authors had\\nthe chance to publish\_it.\\n\\nIsn't
        that\_awful?\\n\\nAnd that was what had been gnawing at the back of my mind
        for all those\\nyears. *It's too much work, isn't it*? If someone couldn't
        be bothered\\nto write their own paper, why take the time to translate a paper,
        why\\nnot just make something up or copy/paste something already in English\\n(this
        was before the days of plagiarism detection)? There had to be an\\nintermediary.
        Someone who was already doing the translation work anyway\\nwho could gain
        further by selling the manuscript.\\n\\nBut the other thing was realising
        that, despite all that time spent\\nstudying papermills, I had encountered
        one and not even realised\_it.\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nI learned some valuable lessons\_there.\\n\\n-
        First: in a plagiarism case, it is absolutely possible for the fake to\\n
        \ be published before the original.\\n- Second: it was very easy for me to
        focus on my own remit\u200A---\u200Amy job\\n  was to manage the journal and
        deal with occasional research fraud\\n  cases. It wasn't my problem to understand
        the mechanisms by which that\\n  fraud was happening industrially, that's
        an\_SEP.\\n\\nI think that that's one reason why the scale of the papermill
        problem\\nwas never really understood until recently\u200A---\u200Awe only
        ever saw one\\ntentacle at a time and it was no one's job to tug on them.
        Papermills\\nare great at hiding in plain\_sight.\\n\\n[By the end of 2023,
        the scope of the Papermill Alarm was comprehensive.\\nWe had unique Oversight
        of the whole problem. Its history, its methods,\\nand\_scale.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03464-x)\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/549/1*S6yP5iDlszTWs9OI5486-g.png\\\"

        had also already built a method which could\u200A---\u200Aquite\\nby accident\u200A---\u200Adetect
        the behaviour described above. Again, the\\nduplicate check in the Article
        Tracker would potentially catch a case\\nlike this at the moment of submission
        (but it would still be up to the\\ninvestigator to work out which paper was
        the original).\\n\\nOne key thing here is that, as we see patterns emerging
        that 'plain\\nsight' part becomes acutely\_obvious.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*S437zT85OUIDwLpQi-qYpg.png\\\"

        Addendum\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*My definition of 'papermill' is 'organised research
        fraud' or, more\\nnerdily, 'any repeatable pattern of fraudulent behaviour'.
        So, commit\\nfraud once and that's bad, but do it twice and you're on the
        radar. So a\\ntranslation service that sells manuscripts constitutes a papermill.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*I
        think that Clear Skies can claim the first 'detection' of a\\nChatGPT-generated
        paper ([I'm not sure if 'detection' is the right\\nword\u200A---\u200Ait was
        just a Google\\nsearch](https://x.com/ClearSkiesAdam/status/1647861389573103617)!).
        But\\nthat was one route we didn't go down. Technical solutions for genAI-text\\ndetection
        are dubious at best and, even at that time, it was clear that\\nthe legitimate
        use-cases for genAI were going to eclipse the fraudulent\\nones. I think there
        are useful applications for genAI-related fraud\\ndetection, but it's\_nuanced.\\n\\n![](https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=85e51803cbfa){width=\\\"1\\\"\\nheight=\\\"1\\\"}\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/g718f-4kk96\",\"guid\":\"https://medium.com/p/85e51803cbfa\",\"id\":\"d4c34c53-98a7-4df2-a8e3-5dad203dac9c\",\"image\":\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZCIW-42TiMHET6-AQOY-gA.png\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1735729688,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"rid\":\"9fvex-wqy51\",\"status\":\"active\",\"summary\":\"<strong>\\n

        (in fact, terminal) health conditions,\\nmost notably kidney failure that
        requires dialysis 5 times per week. I\\nwas hired away from a tenured-equivalent
        full Professorship at a\\nuniversity; a very secure position. Yet, relatively
        soon after starting,\\nmy department was abolished.\\n\\nI should note that
        my performance at Crossref was never questioned. My\\nannual development review
        feedback was extremely positive and I was told\\nthat the redundancy was no
        reflection on my performance. My work at\\nCrossref -- and particularly my
        publication record while there -- has\\nattracted great attention and been
        covered in/by *Nature News*, *New\\nScientist* (23rd March 2024, p. 48), *Ars
        Technica*, *Research\\nProfessional*, *Research Information*, the *LSE Impact
        Blog*, the\\n*Digital Preservation Coalition*, *CLOCKSS*, *Research Buzz*,
        *InfoDoc\\nMicroVeille*, *DigitalKoans*, and *FE News*. Furthermore, earlier
        this\\nyear I was awarded the Association of University Presses StandUP Award.\\nI
        was particularly pleased that *Nature* [ran an editorial just recently\\nstarting
        with my digital preservation\\nwork](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03842-z)
        indicating the\\nclear community value of this work. It is a shame that I
        won't get to\\ncontinue this work at Crossref.\\n\\nIt is also, in my opinion,
        a shame that Labs is no more and I do not\\nunderstand the decision when,
        as above, we were attracting such\\ncommunity interest. The Crossref R&D Department
        (\\\"Labs\\\") has been\\nresponsible for so many of their community successes
        over the past two\\ndecades and more recently. Similarity Check, ORCID, CrossMark,
        the REST\\nAPI, Participation Reports, Metadata Search, Funder Ref, ROR, Chooser,\\nLabs
        Reports, Matching, and Retraction Watch were all products\\noriginally of
        the Labs/R&D team.\\n\\nIn any case, moving on. I did quite a bit of publishing
        and writing this\\nyear, with a fair few pieces lined up for near future.\\n\\n###

        mensch einmal anf\xE4ngt, darauf zu achten, erweist sich Wissenschaft\\nan
        vielen Stellen als ein erstaunlich schmutziges Gesch\xE4ft. Das ist\\nallen
        irgendwie an der Wissenschaft Beteiligten klar. Ebenso wissen\\nalle, wie
        sehr die Sonntagsreden und -bilder von selbstlos und nur der\\nWahrheit verpflichteten
        Forschenden, die in B\xFCros und Laboren, in\\nBibliotheken und Archiven,
        auf Feldforschung und bei Ausgrabungen einzig\\nvom Wunsch getrieben sind,
        den Menschen zu helfen, die Welt besser zu\\nmachen und die bestm\xF6gliche
        Wissenschaftspraxis zu betreiben, ein\\nIdealbild darstellen. Mit der kleinteiligen
        und vielschichtigen Realit\xE4t\\nder Wissenschaft hat das erfahrungsgem\xE4\xDF
        wenig zu tun.\\nWissenschaftler\\\\*innen sind Menschen, mit allen ihren Fehlern,\\nindividuellen
        Interessen und Motivationen sowie blinden Flecken. So\\nweit, so erwartbar.
        Nicht jede\\\\*r muss idealistisch sein.\\n\\nProblematisch wird es jedoch,
        wenn das Ideal nicht mehr Zielpunkt,\\nsondern nur noch eine Fassade ist,
        hinter der ganz bewusst gemauschelt,\\nbetrogen und missbraucht wird. Oder
        wenn Wissenschaft zur Zielscheibe\\noder zum Werkzeug f\xFCr Scamming, Vort\xE4uschung
        und Manipulation wird.\_\\n\\nDann entsteht schnell der Eindruck, dass es
        nicht nur um einzelne\\nPersonen geht, die vielleicht unter Leistungs- und
        Publikationsdruck\\nstehen und deshalb Daten f\xE4lschen oder bereits publizierte
        Artikel\\nmehrfach einreichen. Vielmehr entsteht die Sorge, dass teilweise
        mit\\nkrimineller Energie vorgegangen wird.\\n\\n\xDCberrascht das? Eher nicht,
        wenn mensch sich ansieht, wie viel Geld im\\nWissenschaftssystem vorhanden
        ist, wie viel Macht eine\\nWissenschaftskarriere mit sich bringen kann und
        wie sich\\nwissenschaftliche Reputation in externe Gewinne f\xFCr Expert\\\\*innen,\\nBerater\\\\*innen,
        Autor\\\\*innen \xFCbersetzen l\xE4sst.\\n\\nAuch ist die Vergabe von Forschungsmitteln
        und Professuren mittlerweile\\nstark an die Messbarkeit von Erfolg gebunden
        mit Parametern wie dem\\nHirsch-Index, der als vermeintlich objektiver Indikator
        f\xFCr Reputation,\\nausgedr\xFCckt durch die Anzahl der Publikationen und
        Zitationen einer\\nPerson, gilt. Das Wissenschaftssystem erzeugt damit einen
        immensen\\nDruck, der sichtbare und messbare Erfolge einfordert und der durch
        die\\nRestriktionen des deutschen Wissenschaftszeitvertragsgesetzes\\nunerbittlich
        auf die Forschenden einwirkt. Werden keine Gelder\\neingeworben und der n\xE4chste
        Karriereschritt nicht in den vorgegebenen\\nZeitfenstern erreicht, bedeutet
        das f\xFCr viele, oftmals hochqualifizierte\\nMenschen, nicht mehr im deutschen
        Wissenschaftsbereich arbeiten zu\\nk\xF6nnen -- und damit im Wesentlichen
        nicht einer Forschungst\xE4tigkeit\\nnachgehen zu k\xF6nnen. Zu diesen prek\xE4ren
        Besch\xE4ftigungsverh\xE4ltnissen in\\nAkademia informieren unter anderem
        die Social-Media-Diskurse\\n\\\\#IchBinHanna oder \\\\#IchBinReyhan.\\n\\n#
        Beispiele {#beispiele .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nEine ganze Anzahl von wissenschaftstypischen,
        betr\xFCgerischen Praktiken\\nsind in gewisser Weise schon etabliert: Zitationskartelle;\\nAutor\\\\*innenschaften
        von Personen, die gar nicht an einer Publikation\\nbeteiligt waren; Beitr\xE4ge
        auf Publikationslisten, die es in Wirklichkeit\\nnie gab; Plagiate. Das nicht
        hoch genug zu lobende Blog [Retraction\\nWatch](https://retractionwatch.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"} liefert dazu kontinuierlich neue F\xE4lle.\\n\\nAber in der
        letzten Zeit scheinen sich die Praktiken immer mehr\\nauszuweiten. Nicht nur
        von der eigentlichen Anzahl her, sondern auch von\\nden Praktiken und deren
        Grad an Professionalit\xE4t. Der Term \\\"Journal\\nHijacking\\\" kam zum
        Beispiel neu in unseren Wortschatz.\_ (vgl. Albakina,\\n2021) Der Ansatz bedeutet,
        dass jemand die Kopie eines\\nOpen-Access-Journals anlegt, welche nur eine
        ganz geringf\xFCgige\\nAbweichung zum Original hat \u2012 beispielsweise ein
        \\\"the\\\" vor dem\\nZeitschriftennamen \u2012, diese Kopie als das Original
        in den betreffenden\\nDatenbanken hinterlegt, um vom Ruf der Originalzeitschrift
        zu\\nprofitieren und dann gegen Zahlung von Artikelgeb\xFChren jeden\\neingereichten
        Artikel zu ver\xF6ffentlichen. (Im Kontext von hijacked\\njournal gibt es
        eine Reihe von Herausforderungen und Problemen; zu\\nHandlungsoptionen f\xFCr
        Verlage siehe Ryan (2024); zu Vorkommen von\\nPlagiaten in hijacked journals
        siehe Abalkina (2024).) Fast schon\\nnebenher haben wir in einigen Artikeln
        erfahren (zum Beispiel Singh\\nChawla (2024)), dass heute Zitationen genauso
        gekauft werden k\xF6nnen, wie\\nsonst Follower f\xFCr die verschiedenen Social-Media-Netzwerke.\_\\n\\nGleichzeitig
        lassen sich Texte, Daten und Bilder dank generativer\\nKI-Anwendungen noch
        schneller und einfacher f\xE4lschen, als zuvor (siehe\\nzum Beispiel Kendall,
        da Silva 2024; Sabel et al. 2023; Gu et al. 2022).\\nAndererseits findet sich
        auch die Erwartung, dass technische Anwendungen\\ngerade sehr gut geeignet
        sind, um Betrugsversuche zu entdecken (u.a.\\nFreedman ; Toni 2024). Eine
        \xDCbersicht zu mit ChatGPT generierten\\nwissenschaftlichen Aufs\xE4tzen
        gibt es zum Beispiel bei\\n[Retractionwatch](https://retractionwatch.com/papers-and-peer-reviews-with-evidence-of-chatgpt-writing/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer

        nach Beitr\xE4gen, die sich in\\ndas Themenfeld Lug und Trug im Wissenschaftssystem
        wagen. Insbesondere\\nnach solchen, die auch danach fragen, was dies mit Bibliotheken
        zu tun\\nhat. Hat es zum Beispiel Einfluss auf die Arbeit von Bibliotheken
        im\\nFeld Informationskompetenz, Forschungsdatenmanagement oder \u2012\\ninsbesondere,
        wenn es um Artikel- oder Publikationsgeb\xFChren geht \u2012 Open\\nAccess?
        Sind Bibliotheken diesen Praktiken einfach ausgeliefert? Wenn\\nja, mit welchen
        Konsequenzen? Oder haben sie schon Gegenstrategien\\nentwickelt? Nicht zuletzt
        sind die Berichte zu Betrug im\\nWissenschaftssystem selbstverst\xE4ndlich
        nicht neu. Aber wie hat sich das\\nThema in den letzten Jahren, gar Jahrzehnten
        entwickelt? K\xF6nnen wir\\nvielleicht etwas aus fr\xFCheren \\\"Wellen\\\"
        an Betrug lernen?\\n\\nOder gibt es Erfahrungen oder Strategien zum Umgang
        mit Plagiaten\\nund/oder Plagiatssoftware beziehungsweise KI-generierten Haus-

        \ \\n\\nEx Libris surprised us by suddenly [releasing Primo Research Assistant\\nto
        production on September 9,\\n2024\_](https://exlibrisgroup.com/announcement/ex-libris-primo-research-assistant-is-now-available-for-primo-institutions/)\_(when\\nthe
        earlier timeline was 4Q 2024 with some believing it might even be\\ndelayed).
        Despite the fact that there are so many [RAG (retrieval\\naugmented generation)
        academic search\\nsystems](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/p/list-of-academic-search-engines-that.html)\\ntoday
        that generate answers from search, this is still quite a\\nsignificant event
        to be worth covering in my blog.\\n\\nWhy? Simply put, while Primo Research
        Assistant may not break any new\\nground in terms of features or functionality,
        in all likelihood this\\nmight be the first academic search system that use
        RAG to generate\\nanswers that many librarians and users will encounter given
        the fact\\nthat Primo together with it\\\\'s cousin Summon (which will have
        it\\\\'s [own\\nResearch Assistant coming soon Q1\\n2025](https://exlibrisgroup.com/announcement/ex-libris-launches-a-beta-program-of-generative-ai-powered-primo-research-assistant/))\\nare
        two of the big 4 default academic search engines used by Academic\\nlibraries
        (the other two are Ebsco Discovery Service and WorldCat\\nDiscovery Service)
        and this feature is bundled in!\\n\\nI estimate this is 20% or so of academic
        libraries in US/UK/Canada etc\\n(likely higher for elite universities).\\n\\nAs
        such, here are some things you should know about Primo Research\\nAssistant
        (Primo RA) and my *first preliminary thoughts* (long). For\\nmore information
        on [Primo Research\\nAssistant.](https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Primo/Product_Documentation/020Primo_VE/Primo_VE_(English)/015_Getting_Started_with_Primo_Research_Assistant)\\n\\n
        \ \\n\\n### \\\\#1 Primo Research Assistant is bundled in with your current
        subscription {#primo-research-assistant-is-bundled-in-with-your-current-subscription
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"}\\n\\nUnlike AI offerings from Elsvier\\\\'s
        ([Scopus\\nAI](https://www.elsevier.com/products/scopus/scopus-ai)) or even\\nClarivate\\\\'s
        (parent of Ex libris) [Web of Science\\\\'s Research\\nAssistant](https://webofscience.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/25929584652561-Web-of-Science-Research-Assistant),\\nthere
        is no additional cost to libraries who already subscribe to Primo.\\n\\nIn
        fact, it is live right now in production, though you can (and\\nprobably should)
        turn it off.\\n\\nDo note as of time of this article, 15th September, librarians
        are\\nreporting that you can only hide the link to Primo Research assistant\\nfrom
        the Primo interface but if you know the link you can still access\\nit.\\n\\nThat
        said even if you do so it will require user authentication to\\naccess.\_\\n\\nIt\\\\'s
        somewhat hard to understand why Ex Libris chose to release this\\nwithout
        additional cost, given that unlike most software features the\\nmarginal cost
        to run RAG enabled searches are not zero due to LLM\\ninference costs and
        the potential users of Primo and Summon are likely\\nto be much larger than
        most academic search systems that currently\\nimplement this technology, but
        as you will see Ex Libris has taken care\\nto mitigate this issue by a) UI
        design and b) technology solutions\\n\\nDespite this, there has been suggestions
        (I forgot where I saw it, but\\nwas probably in a webinar) that Primo Research
        Assistant does have a\\nthreshold/throttle limit if your institution is sending
        too many queries\\nvia the Research Assistant and there might even be a premium
        service\\nadd-on in the future.\\n\\n###   {#section}\\n\\n### \\\\#2 By default
        your searches in Primo do not trigger the Primo Research Assistant {#by-default-your-searches-in-primo-do-not-trigger-the-primo-research-assistant}\\n\\n<div>\\n\\nEven
        if you do opt-in to turn on Primo Research assistant, the default\\nsearch
        does not trigger the Research Assistant to generate an answer.\\nThis is unlike
        other popular tools like Elicit.com, SciSpace etc but\\nsimilar to legacy

        \ \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n**The Landscape: How AI is Shaping Discovery**\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n
        \ \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\nMy immediate reaction? Publishers
        who choose to opt out are shooting\\nthemselves in the foot, much like the
        initial wave of publishers who\\nrefused to be indexed in Google Scholar or
        early discovery indexes like\\nSummon, Primo, and EDS back in the early 2010s.
        Those who resisted\\neventually caved because being absent from these indexes
        meant losing\\ndiscoverability---and by extension, usage---while their competitors\\nbecame
        more visible.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n  \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\nAcademic
        libraries soon put these discovery services front and center as\\nthe default
        search boxes, driving all the traffic there. Publishers\\nquickly realized
        that being indexed meant a significant boost in COUNTER\\nstats, while those
        who weren't saw usage plummet. Google Scholar\\nindexing turned out to be
        even more critical, as everyone knows from\\ntheir traffic analysis.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n
        \ \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n### But It's Not Exactly the Same...\\n\\nEx
        Libris is being cautious with their CDI Research Assistant. It\\\\'s not\\nthe
        default, and a generated answer isn't produced for every search;\\nusers have
        to make a conscious effort to visit another site. So, the\\nimpact of being
        excluded here is less severe, at least for now.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\nThis
        approach mirrors how major products like Scopus AI and Statista are\\nhandling
        it. But if this feature becomes popular, it wouldn't be\\nsurprising if these
        systems switch to a default model where AI-generated\\nanswers, along with
        a list of relevant papers, are always shown---much\\nlike Elicit.com or SciSpace.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n
        \ \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\nIf we reach a point where AI-generated answers
        are the norm, choosing to\\nbe excluded could significantly hurt discoverability.
        The generated\\nanswer is highly prominent, and not being included there isn't
        great.\_\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n  \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n### The
        Case Against Inclusion\_ {#the-case-against-inclusion}\\n\\nOne could argue
        that if their content is cited in a RAG-generated\\nanswer, many users might
        not click through to the full text and instead\\nrely solely on the AI summary.
        This could lead to a drop in usage stats,\\nprompting librarians to consider
        canceling the subscription. This\\nconcern echoes the frustrations some web
        owners have with Google's\\nKnowledge Graph and featured snippets, which they
        believe steal content\\nbecause users no longer click through to the source.\\n\\nBut
        how strong is this argument? It depends on your view of user\\nbehavior.\\n\\nTo
        make this argument work, users would need to be a specific type of\\nlazy---lazy
        enough to rely on an AI-generated summary if it's there, but\\ndiligent enough
        to click through to the full text if it's not.\\n\\nStill despite my analysis,
        we can see more content owners choosing to be\\nexcluded. [Since my last blog

        seem to indicate to me the retrieval is the\\nweakest part of the Primo Research

        effective are research assessment reform initiatives in mobilizing\\ncollective
        action? Framework and case studies of DORA and CoARA\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n***Alex
        Rushforth**\_and Gunnar Sivertsen*\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nRecent years have
        seen considerable growth of reform movements aiming to\\narrest perceived
        dysfunctions across science. A prominent problem that\\nhas formed the focus
        of activism in academia has been research\\nassessment practices. Multi-actor
        initiatives such as the Declaration on\\nResearch Assessment (DORA) and the
        Coalition on Advancing Research\\nAssessment (CoARA) have served as prominent
        backbone organizations for\\nthis movement, coordinating collective action
        among diverse research\\nstakeholders. As governance structures within science,
        a notable\\ncharacteristic is their reliance upon 'soft governance' and 'self\\nregulation',
        rather than incentives or coercion. In this paper we take\\nstock of how effective
        these example initiatives have been in\\ncoordinating and mobilizing collective
        action on their respective\\nproblems. We introduce a framework to compare
        the initiatives, apply it\\nto these two cases, and draw conclusions about
        the respective\\nachievements, challenges, and limitations of these structures.\\n\\nThe
        inventive spill-over of corporate publications\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n*Antoine

        Scherngell, **Alfredo Yegros**, and Philippe Lar\xE9do*\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nThis
        paper looks at how scientific collaboration linking universities\\nand large
        international firms fosters local invention. The first step\\naims at identifying
        the universities engaged in collaboration with large\\ncorporate entities
        belonging to the industrial sectors of\\npharmaceuticals, chemicals and biotechnology.
        After having identified\\nthe corpus of corporate publications authored by
        these enterprises we\\nanalyse in this corpus the universities engaged in
        this corporate\\nscientific collaboration allocating the co-authoring institutions
        in the\\nterritories hosting the academic authors. The extent and nature of
        the\\nuniversities' collaboration with large firms is then analysed using
        the\\nSAR model in regard to the intensity of local inventive intensity in
        the\\nmetropolitan area hosting the universities. The results show that\\ncorporate
        publications have a clear and significant effect on inventive\\noutcome and
        production.\\n\\nIncentivizing, excluding, and enduring: On the complexities

        research assessment prioritises Web of Science publications,\\naiming for
        international impact. This paper examines the policy,\\nintroduced in 2012,
        of excluding articles from journals with low impact\\nfactor or suspected
        citation inflation. We analyse how this suspension\\npolicy affected domestic
        journals and researchers' behaviour. The\\nresults show that Lithuanian researchers'
        publications in foreign\\noutlets increased, but concerns remain about the
        chosen outlets' quality\\nand potential continuing manipulation of Web of
        Science metrics. These\\nare initial findings of a broader study exploring
        policy dynamics and\\nunexpected consequences of quantitative research assessment.\\n\\nDoes
        mobility help to build bridge of collaboration between origin and\\ndestination
        country\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n***Huilin Ge**, **Clara Calero Medina**, and
        **Rodrigo Costas***\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nAcademic mobility is a phenomenon
        in today's academic landscape that\\nfacilitates global collaboration and
        knowledge transfer. Despite the\\nbenefits of academic mobility, concerns
        about brain drain persist, and\\nfears of inequalities in mobility dynamics
        start to emerge. Our research\\nexplores the relationship between mobile researchers
        and the\\ncollaboration ties with their country of origin, revealing a remarkable\\ntrend:
        mobile academics maintain varying degrees of collaboration with\\ntheir origin
        countries after moving. Scholars migrating from\\nhigher-income countries
        to lower-income ones exhibit a strong\\ninclination to maintain ties with
        their highincome origins, but the\\nreverse is not observed. These findings
        suggest unequal benefits of\\nmobility regarding the collaboration ties and
        highlight the necessity\\nfor implementing policies and initiatives geared
        towards nurturing more\\nbeneficial international research collaboration and
        harnessing the\\ncontributions of mobile scientists.\\n\\nFunding flows in
        Africa according to Dimensions grant data\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n***Jonathan
        Dudek**, **Jeroen van Honk**, Isabel Basson, **Carole de\\nBordes**, **Ismael
        Rafols**, and **Rodrigo Costas***\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nMost African countries
        have low domestic research funding and receive a\\nsignificant portion of
        their funding from foreign sources. Consequently,\\nit is of special interest
        to understand funding flows and their\\ninfluence on African research. The
        Dimensions (Digital Science) database\\nbrings together information from publications
        and projects funded by\\nmore than 500 funding agencies from more than 40
        countries. By combining\\ngrant (project) data and funding acknowledgments
        in publications, we\\nanalyse funding flows to African countries: who are
        the main funders?\\nwhich countries and organizations do they support? what
        issues do they\\nprioritize? The study will also explore the possibilities
        and\\nlimitations of using Dimensions funding-related data for the analysis
        of\\nfunding flows between global regions.\\n\\nTaming complexity: narrative
        CVs in grant funding evaluations\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n***Judit Varga**,
        **Wolfgang Kaltenbrunner**, and Helen Buckley Woods*\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nThis
        short paper presents preliminary findings from a research project\\ninvestigating
        the uptake and use of so-called narrative CVs in review\\npanels for research
        funding decisions. Our analysis draws on empirical\\nmaterial collected through
        interviews and participant observation in two\\nsubsequent panel meetings
        of a funding program for early career\\nresearchers of the Dutch national
        research council NWO. As expected, we\\nfind that the recent introduction
        of a narrative CV in this program has\\nnot instantaneously transformed evaluative
        practices. Rather, the\\nemphasis on substantive narrative accounts of applicants'
        achievements,\\ncombined with the backgrounding of quantifiable evidence such
        as\\npublication counts and metrics, leads reviewers to gradually\\nproblematize
        and reconsider previously dominant definitions of quality.\\nOur analysis
        showcases exemplary situations in which such reflection\\nbecomes apparent,
        and it highlights different ways in which reviewers\\ntry to resolve newly
        underdetermined evaluative situations.\\n\\nGeography in Scientific Practice
        and Country Biases\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n***Leyan Wu**, Akrati Saxena, and
        **Vincent Traag***\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nRecent decades witnessed a steady
        increase in international scientific\\ncollaboration, alongside debates on
        nationalist tendencies in scientific\\npractices and global disparities in
        citation flows. Geographical\\nproximity has been shown to influence collaboration
        and citation rates,\\nyet how this affects global patterns remains unclear.
        Addressing this\\ngap, we examine the interplay of geography and country-level
        effects in\\ncollaboration and citations using OpenAlex data. Analysing 1.6
        million\\npublications with 6.8 million collaborations, and 3.7 million citations,\\nwe
        unveil distinct distance dependencies and country-level effects.\\nCollaborations
        between countries decline slower with distance compared\\nto intra-country
        collaborations. Surprisingly, citations between\\ncountries display lower
        distance dependence above a certain threshold,\\nwhile intra-country citations
        decrease notably. These findings suggest\\nthat geographical factors alone
        do not determine inter-country\\ncollaborations and citations, hinting at
        underlying country-level\\neffects that we will explore further in follow-up
        research. This study\\nadvances our understanding of the complex dynamics
        shaping international\\nscientific engagement.\\n\\nThe use of non-institutional

        **Nees Jan van Eck***\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nThe explosion of cases of peer
        review fraud and activities of paper\\nmills pose a systemic threat to the
        integrity of the scientific\\npublishing process. By linking the Retraction
        Watch and Web of Science\\ndatabases, metadata of retracted publications are
        analysed. In the\\nperiod 2007-2021, the use of non-institutional email addresses
        by these\\npublications' reprint authors increased by more than 20%, mainly
        due to\\nan even larger increase from authors with a postal address in India
        and\\nespecially China. Among the journals with the most retracted\\npublications,
        the use of non-institutional email addresses by reprint\\nauthors differs
        greatly: from 7 to 99%. It is also surprising that only\\n36% of the mainly
        Chinese reprint authors of the mass retracted\\npublications in Hindawi journals
        used a non-institutional email address.\\nThese results indicate that caution
        is recommended and not to\\nautomatically red-flag publications as fraudulent
        when non-institutional\\nemail addresses are used.\\n\\nDifferent representations
        of forest science in bibliographic databases\\nand the (in-)visibility of
        Tanzanian research: applying an epistemic\\n(in-)justice lens\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n*Nelius
        Boshoff, Similo Ngwenya, Amani J. Uisso, Susanne Koch, **Rodrigo\\nCostas**,
        and **Jonathan Dudek***\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nInspired by a search for epistemic
        justice, the study examines the\\nrepresentation of Tanzanian forest science
        in five databases:\\nDimensions, OpenAlex, Scopus, Web of Science and a manually
        compiled set\\nof articles in Tanzanian journals. It also ascertains whether
        profiles\\nof three epistemic elements (alignment of research to national
        research\\npriorities, national region studied, and forest type studied) differ\\nbetween
        the databases. Initial findings of the ongoing research indicate\\nthat OpenAlex
        has the highest coverage of Tanzanian forest science\\narticles and that it
        incorporates all the forest science articles of the\\nother databases (excluding
        those in the Tanzanian dataset). In fact, 87%\\nof articles in Tanzanian journals
        do not appear in the other databases'\\nforest science collections. This is
        a form of epistemic injustice as the\\ninvisibility of large parts of forest
        science produced by Tanzanian\\nauthors collectively marginalises them and
        ultimately prevents them from\\nfully participating in scientific meaning-making.\\n\\nCoverage
        and metadata availability of African publications in OpenAlex:\\na comparative
        analysis\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n*Patricia Alonso-\xC1lvarez and **Nees Jan
        van Eck***\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nUnlike traditional proprietary data sources
        like Scopus and the Web of\\nScience (WoS), OpenAlex emphasises its comprehensiveness,
        claiming an\\nextra coverage of humanities, non-English languages, and the
        Global\\nSouth. Strengthening diversity and inclusivity in science is crucial
        for\\nethical and practical reasons. This paper analyses OpenAlex's coverage\\nand
        metadata availability of African-based publications. For this\\npurpose, OpenAlex
        is compared with Scopus, WoS, and African Journals\\nOnline (AJOL). We first
        compare the coverage of African publications in\\nOpenAlex against that of
        WoS, Scopus, and AJOL. We then assess and\\ncompare the available metadata
        for OpenAlex, Scopus, and WoS\\npublications. The analysis shows that OpenAlex
        offers the most extensive\\npublication coverage. Regarding metadata, OpenAlex
        offers a high\\ncoverage of publication and author information. It performs
        worse\\nregarding affiliations, references, and funder information. Importantly,\\nthe
        results also show that metadata availability in OpenAlex is better\\nfor publications
        also indexed in Scopus and WoS.\\n\\nUnexpected consequences of Dutch Open

        van Leeuwen**, Lieuwe Kool, and Ingrid Wijk*\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nIn this
        study we aim at some unintended consequences of science policy\\nregarding
        open access publishing by Dutch academics. Various actors in\\nthe system
        have advocated different forms of open access publishing, and\\nour study
        will unravel how publishing occurs in various forms of open\\naccess publishing
        (Gold versus Hybrid), and for two types of scholarly\\npublishing, the general
        output of the Netherlands and the output for\\nwhich authors located in the
        Netherlands are corresponding authors. A\\nspecial focus will be on any underlying
        field differences across the\\nDutch scholarly landscape. The study shows
        that contrary to national and\\ninternational efforts, the main focus of Dutch
        academics is on Hybrid\\nopen access publishing.\\n\\nHow does SDG Related
        Research Differ?\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n*Tommaso Ciarli, Hugo Confraria, **Ed
        Noyons**, and **Ismael Rafols***\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nThis paper examines
        the characteristics and impact of research related\\nto the Sustainable Development
        Goals (SDGs), aiming to understand\\nspecific features of SDG-related research
        compared to non- SDG related\\nresearch. The findings reveal that SDG-research
        research, especially on\\nSDGs related to people and society (such as poverty
        alleviation,\\neducation, gender equality, and justice) are more likely to
        be cited in\\npolicy documents, indicating their relevance for public use,
        and to\\nadopt features of open science, such as open access and\\ninterdisciplinary.
        However, these publications are less likely to\\nmention funding and are less
        likely to be cited in academic publications\\ncompared to non-SDG-related
        research, suggesting a disconnect between\\npotentially more impactful research
        and academic recognition. Results\\nreveal gaps in research funding priorities
        while emphasising the\\nimportance of considering the societal relevance of
        research alongside\\ntraditional excellence criteria.\\n\\n### Poster presentations\\n\\nUtilising

        study presents the overview of Chinese scholars' international\\nmobility
        based on bibliometrics data from Dimension. We identify\\n2,446,785 individual
        researchers affiliated with China from the\\n2000-2022 period. Based on those
        data, we find that 2,381,665\\nresearchers are not moving in their academic
        careers, and 65,120\\nresearchers have international mobile footprints. Furthermore,
        after\\ndistinguishing China as an origin country and destination country,
        we\\nfind that China has been losing researchers since 2000, with the United\\nStates
        being the main destination for those who move internationally.\\nWhat's more,
        we find that when scholars move, they generally do not\\nchange their research
        fields on a large scale, but some do change their\\nfields, particularly in
        the social sciences. Our study illustrates the\\nlandscape of Chinese researchers'

        STI research focuses on innovations in scholarly\\npublishing as a research
        object, our own scholarly communication\\npractices often rely on more traditional
        (closed) journal - based pre -\\npublication peer review. In this special
        session, we aim to discuss to\\nwhat extent this is an intentional choice,
        and in what ways we might\\nbenefit from the various affordances of open peer
        review - in particular\\nthe prospect of reusing open review reports across
        various outlets or\\ncontexts. The discussion will be prepared by four short
        pitches. First,\\nsome of the organiz ers of the preceding STI conference
        will report\\nabout experiences with open peer review in the 2023 STI iteration
        in\\nLeiden (Ludo Waltman). A second pitch will collect the existing evidence\\non
        implications of open peer review for diversity and participatio n\\n(Serge
        Horbach). A third pitch will reflect what open and portable\\nreview reports
        mean for the workings of the peer review economy in a\\npublishing context
        (Wolfgang Kaltenbrunner). Finally, there will be a\\npitch on the possibilities
        of automation in peer review and its\\nimplications for openness (Felicitas
        Hesselmann).\\n\\nThe subsequent discussion will focus on the following questions:\\n\\n-
        What are STI attendants' motivations to (not) engage in open review\\n  formats?\\n-
        What are the most important opportunities and challenges related to\\n  implementing
        open and portable peer reviews?\\n- How do open and portable reviews alter
        the development of research\\n  arguments and the engagement with audiences?\\n-

        the past five years, the reform movements for open science and\\nresearch
        assessment have expanded significantly. Increasingly, their\\nagendas overlap
        , with champions of open science seeing current\\nassessment practices as
        incentivizing behaviours that hinder wider\\naccommodation of open science
        activities among researchers (UNESCO,\\n2021, Nosek, 2019, Spector, 2022)
        . Reform of academic career assessment\\nsystems is often earmarked as a site
        through which to incentivize\\nacademics to more fully embrace open ways of
        working (e.g. EC, 2017,\\nMustajoki et al., 2021, Pietil\xE4 et al., 2023,
        M\xE9ndez and S\xE1nchez -\\nN\xFA\xF1ez, 2023) . It is of course easy to
        say that researchers in general\\nshould be 'recognized' and 'rewarded' for
        open science (in its various\\nincarnations) . But what might this look like
        in practice, what has\\nactually been tried out so far, how might researchers
        in their roles as\\nevaluators and producers of knowledge respond to such
        steering efforts,\\nand what might be the consequences for career evaluations
        and research\\npractices in different research fields and academic institutional\\nsettings?\\n\\nThis

        Abstract\\n\\nOver the past decade, there has been a significant increase
        in the\\nnumber of bibliometric analyses published in the peer - reviewed\\nliterature,
        particularly outside of library and information science\\nwhere bibliometric

        it also poses challenges in ensuring quality.\\nThe variability in reporting
        quality we currently see may, at least\\npartially, be grounded in the lack
        of guidance on how to conduct and\\nreport bibliometric studies by experts
        from within the field. This\\nspecial session will engage the community in
        a discussion about quality\\nand reporting of bibliometric analyses. Our session
        relates to the\\nconference theme of \\\"Into the great wide open?\\\" in
        that the level of\\nopenness in the bibliometrics community -- our methods
        and analytical\\ntools, the application of our work, our disciplinary backgrounds,

        \ \\nIn its proposal for a new strategy, \\\\\\\"Towards responsible publishing\\\\\\\"
        ,\\ncOAlition S summarizes: \\\"In the five years that have elapsed since
        the\\npublication of the Plan S principles, the move toward full and immediate\\nOpen
        Access (OA) has become global and irreversible.\\\" However, \\\"this has\\nbeen
        delivered through business models -- such as Read and Publish\\nagreements
        and APCs -- which are highly inequitable\\\". The coalition now\\nenvisages
        a \\\"scholar-led\\\" and \\\"community-based\\\" scholarly communication\\nsystem
        \\\"without author-facing charges\\\". Furthermore, the general OA\\nambition
        of Plan S is \\\"extended to include all scholarly outputs, such\\nas preprints
        and peer review reports\\\" because \\\"the current practice of\\npre-publication
        peer review needlessly delays the sharing of research\\noutputs\\\".\\n\\n*Session
        Goals*  \\nThe aim of the session is to discuss the new focuses and priorities
        of\\nCoalition S based on experiences so far -- including evidence provided\\nby
        the areas of research contributing to the STI conferences. Three\\ntopics
        will be prepared for short introductions to start discussions\\nwith the audience:\\n\\n1.
        \ Empirical examination of the OA transformation so far: The\\n    discussion
        will focus on the empirical evidence pertaining to the\\n    transition into
        Open Access publishing in recent years. A core\\n    question will be how
        the transition aligns with the traditional\\n    research policy criteria
        of research quality and affordability.\\n2.  Challenges with changing the
        market of scientific publishing: The\\n    discussion will focus on new initiatives
        for scholarly publishing,\\n    their foundation and implementation issues,
        in particular the vision\\n    of a \\\"scholar-led\\\" and \\\"community-based\\\"
        scholarly communication\\n    system \\\"without author-facing charges\\\".
        To what degree are the\\n    trends in the present market of scientific publishing

        rapidly evolving social landscape, which encompasses\\ncritical issues such
        as climate change, poverty, and technological\\nadvancements, the intersection
        of policy and science holds paramount\\nsignificance. Understanding how research
        informs and shapes policy\\ndecisions has become increasingly crucial, sparking
        discussions on\\nmethodologies for assessing impact. While tools like Overton
        and\\nAltmetric.com have gained popularity, they do not provide neither enough\\ncoverture,
        nor open data, presenting two significant challenges:\\nestablishing open
        - access sources for policy documents and bridging the\\ncoverage gaps between
        the Global South and the Global North. The special\\nsession aims to address
        two specific interests: (i) exploring the\\ndifferences and synergies between
        open and proprietary data sources of\\npolicy documents, and (ii) examining
        the disparities in coverage between\\nthe Global South and Global North regarding
        policy documents and related\\nscholarly outputs within these data sources.
        The proposal aims to foster\\ndebate on potential methodologies for leveraging
        open sources of policy\\ndocuments and for identifying and analyzing inequalities
        in accessing\\nresearch impact on policy. Furthermore, the session seeks to
        explore\\nstrategies for overcoming these inequalities and enhancing the\\nsignificance
        of open data sources in the process.\\n\\nThe session\\\\'s dynamics will
        involve brief speeches from invited guests,\\napproximately 10 minutes each,
        forming a debate panel. Audience\\nparticipation will be encouraged through
        commenting or making questions\\non the topic.\\n\\n### GLOBAL consensus\_meeting\\n\\n[Right

        and *Retraction Watch* just released a large investigation\\ninto what I consider
        a new breed of paper mill. I can explain this\\nphenomenon no better than
        Frederik Joelving's article in *Science*,\\nwhich you can read here:\\n\\n#####
        [Prescription for controversy: Firms offering a fast track to publication
        target foreign applicants to U.S. medical residency programs](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.z7vuqtq)
        {#prescription-for-controversy-firms-offering-a-fast-track-to-publication-target-foreign-applicants-to-u.s.-medical-residency-programs
        .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nEssentially, these businesses sell guaranteed publications
        to\\ninternational medical graduates (IMGs) hoping to attain medical\\nresidency
        in the United States. These publications will hypothetically\\nbeef up the
        customer's CV and increase their chances of being matched.  \\n  \\nMany such
        businesses are based in the United States. They mostly follow\\nvariations
        on the same playbook: for a hefty sum (often around 1,000\\nUSD), the customer
        can attend an online course (often meeting once a\\nweek for an hour for four
        to eight weeks), after which their name will\\nbe on one to five meeting abstracts
        or articles in the \\\"peer reviewed\\\"\\nand indexed literature.\\n\\nHassaan
        Tohid, co-founder and CEO of the [California Institute of\\nBehavioral Neurosciences
        and Psychology\\n(CIBNP)](https://web.archive.org/web/20240430190848/https://www.cibnp.com/),\\nexplains
        in [this\\nvideo](https://youtu.be/RMMozJx1UGg?si=PzfrwMqH0nKMIB8e) that his\\nprogram
        offers courses matching this pattern where customers will obtain\\none published
        paper as first author, four published papers as middle\\nauthor, a letter
        of recommendation, a certificate of completion, and\\npermission to list CIBNP
        as an institutional affiliation for two years.\\n\\nIs eight hours of instruction
        enough for someone to make a genuine\\ncontribution to five research papers?
        I would contend not, but that\\ndoesn't seem to matter to the people selling
        these courses. Often, the\\nmain selling point isn't training, but clout.
        Among the benefits of\\nthese programs, CIBNP lists:\\n\\n> Increase chances
        of residency in the US because only 1 in 3 residency\\n> candidates who match
        has publications. Now just think and answer, how\\n> many of these candidates
        have Meta-Analysis or Systematic Reviews\\n> published? Very very very few.....
        right? Once you have this\\n> publication, you will be one of the top most
        candidates applying for\\n> the US residency.  \\n> ...  \\n> Having a Meta-Analysis
        not only open doors for you as a clinician but\\n> opens more doors for you
        in the university, pharmaceutical, and\\n> corporate industry. You can just
        ask any employer and hand them 2 CVs.\\n> One with a Meta-Analysis published,
        other without it. Then ask them to\\n> invite only one for the interview-
        you will see majority will call the\\n> candidate with Meta-Analysis for interview
        because of immediate\\n> impression of being an expert in the field.  \\n>
        ...  \\n> More feeling of success- once you feel success only then you can
        know\\n> what success is really all about. Success is a feeling which is\\n>
        actually a kind of healthy addiction. Once you are on a journey of\\n> success,
        you want to repeat the process to get the same feeling again\\n> and again.
        Once you learn Meta-Analysis and writing a manuscript, you\\n> surely will
        feel that feeling that is priceless.  \\n> ...  \\n> California name on your
        CV will do wonders for you for your future.\\n\\nCIBNP's website, in anticipation

        as of May 5,\\n2024.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nBelow, the website reads:\\n\\n>
        While so many CiBNP students who learn to write scientific articles\\n> successfully
        write great articles, there still are some students who\\n> would make mistakes,
        and unintentional errors.\\n>\\n> While we teach them research methodology
        and writing, and look after\\n> their writing style and rules and methodology,
        we do know that in\\n> order to get a fast publication some students may produce
        low quality\\n> papers. Therefore, if you come across papers written by our
        students\\n> and find mistakes and errors, rather than laughing, mocking,
        or making\\n> fun of them or criticizing them, please respectfully point out
        the\\n> mistakes so the author can learn and write an improved version of\\n>
        article in the future.\\n>\\n> Our students are young doctors, and your mocking
        and criticism can\\n> destroy their confidence and self-esteem and they may
        give up and stop\\n> writing in the future.\\n>\\n> Many of our students don't
        produce highest quality of articles but we\\n> still appreciate our students
        and love them unconditionally.\\n>\\n> We teach our students honesty, and
        integrity, and educate them about\\n> the importance of truth and honesty.
        Yet it is also possible that any\\n> of our students lies or fabricates data
        in the paper deliberately.\\n> Therefore, we CiBNP hold no responsibility
        of the content of the\\n> article produced. We teach the students the importance
        of honesty and\\n> integrity and if they still don't listen to us and make
        intentional\\n> mistakes or fabricate the data, and submit to a journal and\\n>
        accidentally the journal reviewers missed the mistakes and journal\\n> publishes
        that article, then the student is himself/herself\\n> responsible.\\n>\\n>
        Just like a medical school that trains students to become doctors and\\n>
        if the same student becomes a corrupt doctor or harms the patient\\n> deliberately
        or unintentionally, is the medical school responsible?\\n> Similarly, when
        a building or a bridge collapses due to bad\\n> calculations by the civil
        engineers, should we hold the engineering\\n> university responsible? The
        obvious answer is NO.\\n>\\n> Similarly, if our students who learned the skill
        of writing and make\\n> deliberate mistakes or are involved in scientific
        fraud or fabrication\\n> of data, should we be responsible? For this reason
        we don't take\\n> responsibility of the scientific content and our students
        sign an\\n> agreement and agree that they are fully responsible for the content.\\n>
        CiBNP and its faculty can only teach and guide but are not responsible\\n>
        for the content, fabrication, or deception or lies of any kind, the\\n> content
        is solely Students' responsibility.\\n\\nAs you might guess from this disclaimer
        absolving CIBNP from any of its\\nstudent's errors or misconduct, the publications
        produced by these\\ntraining programs are often not very good. I've included
        an updating\\nlist of select PubPeer threads for articles originating from
        these\\nbusinesses at the bottom of this post.\\n\\nThe global landscape of
        medical training is exceptionally unequal and\\nhyper-competitive. Within
        this system, dozens of businesses have emerged\\nto prey on aspiring doctors
        from the Global South, litter the medical\\nliterature with low-quality and
        fraudulent studies, and throw these\\ndoctors under the bus when the backlash
        begins. While some of these\\nbusinesses may have helped a handful of doctors
        to surmount the high\\nwalls surrounding the United States medical system,
        the for-profit\\nnature of these businesses ensures this privilege is only
        available to\\nthose that can pay, perpetuating the same inequality that these\\nbusinesses
        claim to fight. CIBNP is right; the victims of these\\nbusinesses deserve
        our compassion, not our scorn.\\n\\nAs long as global economies of scientific
        and medical research remain\\nhighly stratified and cutthroat, paper mills
        will continue to\\nmaterialize to exploit these ills and the people most vulnerable
        to\\nthem.\\n\\n#### Selected publications from IMG-targeting paper mills

        Image\\nLibrary.</a></em></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nBecause cell lines
        can grow indefinitely, one research laboratory or\\nlaboratory supplier can
        take a few cells from their cell line stock and\\ngive them to another laboratory
        for that laboratory to begin culturing\\ntheir own stock. By far the most
        popular cell line is\\n[HeLa](https://www.cellosaurus.org/CVCL_0030), and
        the many of thousands\\nof HeLa cell stocks used in biomedical research around
        the world can all\\nbe traced back to the original stock of \\\"immortal\\\"
        cervical cancer cells\\ntaken from [Henrietta Lacks in\\n1951](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Lacks).\\n\\nOne
        complication of relying on cell lines for biomedical research is\\nthat stocks
        will often become cross-contaminated by other cell lines.\\nFor instance,
        HeLa is extremely aggressive as cancer cell lines go and\\nHeLa cells will
        easily overtake other cell line stocks that are stored\\nnearby. The popular
        gastric cancer cell line\\n[BGC-823](https://www.cellosaurus.org/CVCL_3360)
        is one such victim of\\nHeLa's aggression; there are no remaining uncontaminated
        stocks of\\nBGC-823 and thus it is no longer considered an appropriate experimental\\nmodel
        for gastric cancer. The International Cell Line Authentication\\nCommittee
        maintains [a register of misidentified cell\\nlines](https://iclac.org/databases/cross-contaminations/)
        that is\\ncurrently 582 entries long. A good number of these cell lines were\\ncontaminated
        by cells from a completely different organism, such as\\nhuman salivary gland
        cell line\\n[CAC2](https://www.cellosaurus.org/CVCL_6883), which is actually
        made up\\nof unknown cells from a rat.\\n\\nBecause [different cell lines
        can have a wide variety of responses to\\nthe same\\ntreatment](https://www.cancerrxgene.org/compound/Paclitaxel/11/overview/ic50),\\nit
        is essential that researchers avoid misidentified cell lines and only\\nwork
        with authenticated cell lines that actually represent their system\\nof interest.\\n\\n<figure

        of\\nCancer*](https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.34995), we can now report on a\\nwhole
        new threat to biomedical research: cell lines that never existed\\nin the
        first place.\\n\\nThe names of cell lines are usually just a jumble of letters
        and numbers\\nand thus can often be easily confused. For instance, the name
        of BGC-823\\nis very similar to that of\\n[MGC-803](https://www.cellosaurus.org/CVCL_5334),
        another misidentified\\ngastric cancer cell line. One might easily misspell
        these cell lines as\\n\\\"BGC-803\\\" or \\\"MGC-823\\\". However, we noticed
        that sometimes these\\nmisspelled identifiers were used to refer to another
        cell line entirely\\ndistinct from these existing cell lines. Take the 2021

        B. Aggarwal is an Indian-American biochemist who worked at MD\\nAnderson Cancer

        drawn to curcumin, a non-toxic\\ncompound found in turmeric that has long
        been staple in Ayurvedic\\nsystems of medicine. He authored more than 120
        articles about the\\ncompound from 1994 to 2020. These articles reported that
        curcumin had\\ntherapeutic potential for a variety of diseases, including
        various\\ncancers, Alzheimer's disease and, more recently, COVID-19. In his

        Cancer Center\\nlaunched a research fraud probe against Aggarwal which eventually
        led to\\n30 of Aggarwal's articles being retracted. Only some of these studies\\nwere
        about curcumin specifically, but most concerned similar natural\\nproducts.\\n\\nRetractions
        rarely number this high for a single author; according to\\nthe [Retraction

        26 other people have authored this many retracted studies.\\nAggarwal's retracted

        The Papermill Alarm has grown to become a comprehensive mix\\nof methods for
        detecting organised research fraud and simplifying a\\ncomplex problem. But
        there's something new. Something bigger and better\\nfrom Clear\_Skies.\\n\\nDo
        you know what an \\\"SEP field\\\" is? It's from Douglas\_Adams:\\n\\n> An
        SEP is something we can't see, or don't see, or our brain doesn't\\n> let
        us see, because we think that it's somebody else's problem. That's\\n> what
        SEP means. Somebody Else's Problem. The brain just edits it out,\\n> it's
        like a blind\_spot.\\n\\nI used to think the \\\"SEP field\\\"\u200A---\u200Aa
        fictional tool for making\\nsomething invisible\u200A---\u200Awas just a joke,
        but the more I think about it\\nthe more I think it's a real\_thing.\\n\\nI'd
        spent a chunk of COVID lockdown working out a scalable solution to\\nthe papermill
        detection problem. Papermills were a small part of what I\\nwanted to do with
        Clear Skies, but it was already clear to me at that\\ntime that this was going
        to be a big project. I made this solution into\\nan API (called \\\"Papermill
        Alarm\\\" available via RapidAPI) allowing\\npublishers to self-serve and
        screen their submissions for problematic\\ncontent. The Papermill Alarm was
        the first commercial service\\n*dedicated* to papermill detection (but it's
        probably worth mentioning\\nthat it wasn't the first papermill detector that
        we released\u200A---\u200A[that\\nwas the duplicate submission check in the
        Clear Skies Article\\nTracker](https://medium.com/@clearskiesadam/how-to-find-all-the-papermills-step-1-f00c624facb1)).\\n\\nSome
        publishers were quick to hop onto the API and start using it. By\\nand large,
        it was used responsibly and it felt great to know that the\\nservice was helping
        people. Sadly, there was a small amount of abuse of\\nthat service by papermills
        (and even by one publisher), so the free\\nversion was short-lived, but I
        think it showed that papermill detection\\nwas a tractable problem.\\n\\nThe
        whole time, there was something in the back of my\_mind.\\n\\nIt must have
        been at least a decade ago. I was editing a journal and I\\nsaw a referee
        make the best catch I've ever seen. A manuscript was sent\\nto him for review
        and he responded with a copy of a published paper\\nwritten in his native
        language. He pointed out\_that\\n\\n- the published paper was identical to
        the manuscript I'd sent him\\n  except the one I had sent him had been translated
        to English\_and\\n- the original, which had been published some time previously,
        had\\n  different author names on\_it.\\n- So it looked like someone had simply
        translated a paper, put their own\\n  name on it and sent it off for review
        hoping to get a paper published\\n  without actually doing any research.\\n\\nIt
        was really odd, but the team handled it like your typical plagiarism\\ncase.
        The matter was investigated & authors asked to explain. When they\\ncouldn't,
        the manuscript was rejected, and the authors were warned off\\nrepeat behaviour.\\n\\nEven
        after it was all finished, something was bothering me, but it went\\nto the
        back of my\_mind.\\n\\nHop forward to late-2022 and it was clear that there
        was demand for the\\nPapermill Alarm, but that early version needed to\_develop.\\n\\n[I've
        always viewed misconduct detection as a network analysis\\nproblem](https://medium.com/@clearskiesadam/papermills-in-peer-review-c507b12aa4ac).\\nIndeed,
        it turns out that network analysis is the primary analytical\\nmethod employed
        for fraud detection in other industries, too.\\n\\nOne method that was in
        constant development from shortly after the\\nPapermill Alarm's initial release
        was 'Keystone'. [Keystone is a network\\nanalysis that finds the individuals
        most-connected to research\\nfraud](https://medium.com/@clearskiesadam/keystone-papermill-detection-with-network-analysis-3a48de927406).\\nThe
        choice of name isn't an accident. The keystone in a building is\\nusually
        the one that holds it all together\u200A---\u200Aif you remove a brick\\nfrom
        a structure, it will probably be ok, but remove the keystone and it\\nall
        falls down. I think that these individuals are structurally\\nimportant to
        the networks of bad actors that perpetuate research fraud.\\nIf we're going
        to point limited resources at investigations we should\\ntarget the dealers,
        not the users. So this shows where we might focus\\nour\_efforts.\\n\\nBy
        early 2023, misconduct detection was clearly in-vogue. So we expanded\\nthe
        tool to cover all areas of science as well as adding new detection\\npipelines
        and an introductory version (called \\\"Papermill Alarm: Public\\\")\\nfor
        cases where data was limited.\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nThen I heard a\_story.\\n\\nAn
        author had submitted a paper to a journal, only to be accused of\\nplagiarism.
        The journal had already received an identical paper with\\ndifferent authorship.
        Classic plagiarism case,\_right?\\n\\nBut the author protested and insisted
        that the paper was their own\\noriginal work. They hadn't shared it, *but
        they had written the work in\\ntheir native language, and then sent it to
        a translation company to be\\ntranslated to English.* So it seemed that the
        paper had been translated\\nby the translation company and that the translation
        company had then\\nsold the manuscript to different 'authors' before the real
        authors had\\nthe chance to publish\_it.\\n\\nIsn't that\_awful?\\n\\nAnd
        that was what had been gnawing at the back of my mind for all those\\nyears.
        *It's too much work, isn't it*? If someone couldn't be bothered\\nto write
        their own paper, why take the time to translate a paper, why\\nnot just make
        something up or copy/paste something already in English\\n(this was before
        the days of plagiarism detection)? There had to be an\\nintermediary. Someone
        who was already doing the translation work anyway\\nwho could gain further
        by selling the manuscript.\\n\\nBut the other thing was realising that, despite
        all that time spent\\nstudying papermills, I had encountered one and not even
        realised\_it.\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nI learned some valuable lessons\_there.\\n\\n-
        First: in a plagiarism case, it is absolutely possible for the fake to\\n
        \ be published before the original.\\n- Second: it was very easy for me to
        focus on my own remit\u200A---\u200Amy job\\n  was to manage the journal and
        deal with occasional research fraud\\n  cases. It wasn't my problem to understand
        the mechanisms by which that\\n  fraud was happening industrially, that's
        an\_SEP.\\n\\nI think that that's one reason why the scale of the papermill

        Addendum\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*My definition of 'papermill' is 'organised research
        fraud' or, more\\nnerdily, 'any repeatable pattern of fraudulent behaviour'.
        So, commit\\nfraud once and that's bad, but do it twice and you're on the
        radar. So a\\ntranslation service that sells manuscripts constitutes a papermill.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*I
        think that Clear Skies can claim the first 'detection' of a\\nChatGPT-generated
        paper ([I'm not sure if 'detection' is the right\\nword\u200A---\u200Ait was
        just a Google\\nsearch](https://x.com/ClearSkiesAdam/status/1647861389573103617)!).
        But\\nthat was one route we didn't go down. [Technical solutions for\\ngenAI-text
        detection are dubious at best and, even at that time, it was\\nclear that
        the legitimate use-cases for genAI were going to eclipse the\\nfraudulent
        ones](https://medium.com/p/01f6c3d8e05c). I think there are\\nuseful applications

        most years, a mixed bag for me here. Kidney failure continues to be\\na truly
        challenging medical fiasco, with AV fistulas, overnight\\ndialysis, hormone
        therapies, and much much more. I also continue to feel\\nthe severe difficulties
        of my rheumatoid arthritis, which required a hip\\nreplacement in April.\\n\\nFor
        most of this year, I worked at Crossref -- until I was made\\nredundant (at
        the end of November) due to the abolition of Crossref Labs\\n(as anyone on
        LinkedIn will be able to see, almost all members of the\\nLabs/R&D team are
        now looking for work and the remaining member on the\\nCrossref website is
        listed as now belonging to the \\\"data science\\\"\\ndepartment instead of
        R&D). This was deeply frustrating. I was hired to\\nstart in January 2023.
        It is well known that I am a vulnerable\\nindividual with serious long-term
        (in fact, terminal) health conditions,\\nmost notably kidney failure that
        requires dialysis 5 times per week. I\\nwas hired away from a tenured-equivalent
        full Professorship at a\\nuniversity; a very secure position. Yet, relatively
        soon after starting,\\nmy department was abolished.\\n\\nI should note that
        my performance at Crossref was never questioned. My\\nannual development review
        feedback was extremely positive and I was told\\nthat the redundancy was no
        reflection on my performance. My work at\\nCrossref -- and particularly my
        publication record while there -- has\\nattracted great attention and been
        covered in/by *Nature News*, *New\\nScientist* (23rd March 2024, p. 48), *Ars
        Technica*, *Research\\nProfessional*, *Research Information*, the *LSE Impact
        Blog*, the\\n*Digital Preservation Coalition*, *CLOCKSS*, *Research Buzz*,
        *InfoDoc\\nMicroVeille*, *DigitalKoans*, and *FE News*. Furthermore, earlier
        this\\nyear I was awarded the Association of University Presses StandUP Award.\\nI
        was particularly pleased that *Nature* [ran an editorial just recently\\nstarting
        with my digital preservation\\nwork](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03842-z)
        indicating the\\nclear community value of this work. It is a shame that I
        won't get to\\ncontinue this work at Crossref.\\n\\nIt is also, in my opinion,
        a shame that Labs is no more and I do not\\nunderstand the decision when,
        as above, we were attracting such\\ncommunity interest. The Crossref R&D Department
        (\\\"Labs\\\") has been\\nresponsible for so many of their community successes
        over the past two\\ndecades and more recently. Similarity Check, ORCID, CrossMark,
        the REST\\nAPI, Participation Reports, Metadata Search, Funder Ref, ROR, Chooser,\\nLabs
        Reports, Matching, and Retraction Watch were all products\\noriginally of
        the Labs/R&D team.\\n\\nIn any case, moving on. I did quite a bit of publishing
        and writing this\\nyear, with a fair few pieces lined up for near future.\\n\\n###

        wenn das Ideal nicht mehr Zielpunkt,\\nsondern nur noch eine Fassade ist,
        hinter der ganz bewusst gemauschelt,\\nbetrogen und missbraucht wird. Oder
        wenn Wissenschaft zur Zielscheibe\\noder zum Werkzeug f\xFCr Scamming, Vort\xE4uschung
        und Manipulation wird.\_\\n\\nDann entsteht schnell der Eindruck, dass es
        nicht nur um einzelne\\nPersonen geht, die vielleicht unter Leistungs- und
        Publikationsdruck\\nstehen und deshalb Daten f\xE4lschen oder bereits publizierte
        Artikel\\nmehrfach einreichen. Vielmehr entsteht die Sorge, dass teilweise
        mit\\nkrimineller Energie vorgegangen wird.\\n\\n\xDCberrascht das? Eher nicht,
        wenn mensch sich ansieht, wie viel Geld im\\nWissenschaftssystem vorhanden
        ist, wie viel Macht eine\\nWissenschaftskarriere mit sich bringen kann und
        wie sich\\nwissenschaftliche Reputation in externe Gewinne f\xFCr Expert\\\\*innen,\\nBerater\\\\*innen,
        Autor\\\\*innen \xFCbersetzen l\xE4sst.\\n\\nAuch ist die Vergabe von Forschungsmitteln
        und Professuren mittlerweile\\nstark an die Messbarkeit von Erfolg gebunden
        mit Parametern wie dem\\nHirsch-Index, der als vermeintlich objektiver Indikator
        f\xFCr Reputation,\\nausgedr\xFCckt durch die Anzahl der Publikationen und
        Zitationen einer\\nPerson, gilt. Das Wissenschaftssystem erzeugt damit einen
        immensen\\nDruck, der sichtbare und messbare Erfolge einfordert und der durch
        die\\nRestriktionen des deutschen Wissenschaftszeitvertragsgesetzes\\nunerbittlich
        auf die Forschenden einwirkt. Werden keine Gelder\\neingeworben und der n\xE4chste

        das f\xFCr viele, oftmals hochqualifizierte\\nMenschen, nicht mehr im deutschen
        Wissenschaftsbereich arbeiten zu\\nk\xF6nnen -- und damit im Wesentlichen
        nicht einer Forschungst\xE4tigkeit\\nnachgehen zu k\xF6nnen. Zu diesen prek\xE4ren

        noopener\\\"} liefert dazu kontinuierlich neue F\xE4lle.\\n\\nAber in der
        letzten Zeit scheinen sich die Praktiken immer mehr\\nauszuweiten. Nicht nur
        von der eigentlichen Anzahl her, sondern auch von\\nden Praktiken und deren
        Grad an Professionalit\xE4t. Der Term \\\"Journal\\nHijacking\\\" kam zum
        Beispiel neu in unseren Wortschatz.\_ (vgl. Albakina,\\n2021) Der Ansatz bedeutet,
        dass jemand die Kopie eines\\nOpen-Access-Journals anlegt, welche nur eine
        ganz geringf\xFCgige\\nAbweichung zum Original hat \u2012 beispielsweise ein
        \\\"the\\\" vor dem\\nZeitschriftennamen \u2012, diese Kopie als das Original
        in den betreffenden\\nDatenbanken hinterlegt, um vom Ruf der Originalzeitschrift
        zu\\nprofitieren und dann gegen Zahlung von Artikelgeb\xFChren jeden\\neingereichten
        Artikel zu ver\xF6ffentlichen. (Im Kontext von hijacked\\njournal gibt es
        eine Reihe von Herausforderungen und Problemen; zu\\nHandlungsoptionen f\xFCr
        Verlage siehe Ryan (2024); zu Vorkommen von\\nPlagiaten in hijacked journals
        siehe Abalkina (2024).) Fast schon\\nnebenher haben wir in einigen Artikeln
        erfahren (zum Beispiel Singh\\nChawla (2024)), dass heute Zitationen genauso
        gekauft werden k\xF6nnen, wie\\nsonst Follower f\xFCr die verschiedenen Social-Media-Netzwerke.\_\\n\\nGleichzeitig
        lassen sich Texte, Daten und Bilder dank generativer\\nKI-Anwendungen noch
        schneller und einfacher f\xE4lschen, als zuvor (siehe\\nzum Beispiel Kendall,
        da Silva 2024; Sabel et al. 2023; Gu et al. 2022).\\nAndererseits findet sich
        auch die Erwartung, dass technische Anwendungen\\ngerade sehr gut geeignet
        sind, um Betrugsversuche zu entdecken (u.a.\\nFreedman ; Toni 2024). Eine
        \xDCbersicht zu mit ChatGPT generierten\\nwissenschaftlichen Aufs\xE4tzen

        \ \\n\\nEx Libris surprised us by suddenly [releasing Primo Research Assistant\\nto
        production on September 9,\\n2024\_](https://exlibrisgroup.com/announcement/ex-libris-primo-research-assistant-is-now-available-for-primo-institutions/)\_(when\\nthe
        earlier timeline was 4Q 2024 with some believing it might even be\\ndelayed).
        Despite the fact that there are so many [RAG (retrieval\\naugmented generation)
        academic search\\nsystems](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/p/list-of-academic-search-engines-that.html)\\ntoday
        that generate answers from search, this is still quite a\\nsignificant event
        to be worth covering in my blog.\\n\\nWhy? Simply put, while Primo Research
        Assistant may not break any new\\nground in terms of features or functionality,
        in all likelihood this\\nmight be the first academic search system that use
        RAG to generate\\nanswers that many librarians and users will encounter given
        the fact\\nthat Primo together with it\\\\'s cousin Summon (which will have
        it\\\\'s [own\\nResearch Assistant coming soon Q1\\n2025](https://exlibrisgroup.com/announcement/ex-libris-launches-a-beta-program-of-generative-ai-powered-primo-research-assistant/))\\nare
        two of the big 4 default academic search engines used by Academic\\nlibraries
        (the other two are Ebsco Discovery Service and WorldCat\\nDiscovery Service)
        and this feature is bundled in!\\n\\nI estimate this is 20% or so of academic
        libraries in US/UK/Canada etc\\n(likely higher for elite universities).\\n\\nAs
        such, here are some things you should know about Primo Research\\nAssistant
        (Primo RA) and my *first preliminary thoughts* (long). For\\nmore information
        on [Primo Research\\nAssistant.](https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Primo/Product_Documentation/020Primo_VE/Primo_VE_(English)/015_Getting_Started_with_Primo_Research_Assistant)\\n\\n
        \ \\n\\n### \\\\#1 Primo Research Assistant is bundled in with your current
        subscription {#primo-research-assistant-is-bundled-in-with-your-current-subscription
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"}\\n\\nUnlike AI offerings from Elsvier\\\\'s
        ([Scopus\\nAI](https://www.elsevier.com/products/scopus/scopus-ai)) or even\\nClarivate\\\\'s
        (parent of Ex libris) [Web of Science\\\\'s Research\\nAssistant](https://webofscience.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/25929584652561-Web-of-Science-Research-Assistant),\\nthere
        is no additional cost to libraries who already subscribe to Primo.\\n\\nIn
        fact, it is live right now in production, though you can (and\\nprobably should)
        turn it off.\\n\\nDo note as of time of this article, 15th September, librarians
        are\\nreporting that you can only hide the link to Primo Research assistant\\nfrom
        the Primo interface but if you know the link you can still access\\nit.\\n\\nThat
        said even if you do so it will require user authentication to\\naccess.\_\\n\\nIt\\\\'s
        somewhat hard to understand why Ex Libris chose to release this\\nwithout
        additional cost, given that unlike most software features the\\nmarginal cost
        to run RAG enabled searches are not zero due to LLM\\ninference costs and
        the potential users of Primo and Summon are likely\\nto be much larger than
        most academic search systems that currently\\nimplement this technology, but
        as you will see Ex Libris has taken care\\nto mitigate this issue by a) UI
        design and b) technology solutions\\n\\nDespite this, there has been suggestions
        (I forgot where I saw it, but\\nwas probably in a webinar) that Primo Research
        Assistant does have a\\nthreshold/throttle limit if your institution is sending
        too many queries\\nvia the Research Assistant and there might even be a premium
        service\\nadd-on in the future.\\n\\n###   {#section}\\n\\n### \\\\#2 By default
        your searches in Primo do not trigger the Primo Research Assistant {#by-default-your-searches-in-primo-do-not-trigger-the-primo-research-assistant}\\n\\n<div>\\n\\nEven
        if you do opt-in to turn on Primo Research assistant, the default\\nsearch
        does not trigger the Research Assistant to generate an answer.\\nThis is unlike
        other popular tools like Elicit.com, SciSpace etc but\\nsimilar to legacy
        databases like Scopus AI,\_[Statista\\nResearchAI](https://www.statista.com/research-ai/).\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n

        \ \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n**The Landscape: How AI is Shaping Discovery**\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n
        \ \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\nMy immediate reaction? Publishers
        who choose to opt out are shooting\\nthemselves in the foot, much like the
        initial wave of publishers who\\nrefused to be indexed in Google Scholar or
        early discovery indexes like\\nSummon, Primo, and EDS back in the early 2010s.
        Those who resisted\\neventually caved because being absent from these indexes
        meant losing\\ndiscoverability---and by extension, usage---while their competitors\\nbecame
        more visible.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n  \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\nAcademic
        libraries soon put these discovery services front and center as\\nthe default
        search boxes, driving all the traffic there. Publishers\\nquickly realized
        that being indexed meant a significant boost in COUNTER\\nstats, while those
        who weren't saw usage plummet. Google Scholar\\nindexing turned out to be
        even more critical, as everyone knows from\\ntheir traffic analysis.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n
        \ \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n### But It's Not Exactly the Same...\\n\\nEx
        Libris is being cautious with their CDI Research Assistant. It\\\\'s not\\nthe
        default, and a generated answer isn't produced for every search;\\nusers have
        to make a conscious effort to visit another site. So, the\\nimpact of being
        excluded here is less severe, at least for now.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\nThis
        approach mirrors how major products like Scopus AI and Statista are\\nhandling
        it. But if this feature becomes popular, it wouldn't be\\nsurprising if these
        systems switch to a default model where AI-generated\\nanswers, along with
        a list of relevant papers, are always shown---much\\nlike Elicit.com or SciSpace.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n
        \ \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\nIf we reach a point where AI-generated answers
        are the norm, choosing to\\nbe excluded could significantly hurt discoverability.
        The generated\\nanswer is highly prominent, and not being included there isn't
        great.\_\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n  \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n### The
        Case Against Inclusion\_ {#the-case-against-inclusion}\\n\\nOne could argue
        that if their content is cited in a RAG-generated\\nanswer, many users might
        not click through to the full text and instead\\nrely solely on the AI summary.
        This could lead to a drop in usage stats,\\nprompting librarians to consider
        canceling the subscription. This\\nconcern echoes the frustrations some web
        owners have with Google's\\nKnowledge Graph and featured snippets, which they
        believe steal content\\nbecause users no longer click through to the source.\\n\\nBut
        how strong is this argument? It depends on your view of user\\nbehavior.\\n\\nTo
        make this argument work, users would need to be a specific type of\\nlazy---lazy
        enough to rely on an AI-generated summary if it's there, but\\ndiligent enough
        to click through to the full text if it's not.\\n\\nStill despite my analysis,
        we can see more content owners choosing to be\\nexcluded. [Since my last blog
        post on\\nthis](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2024/08/ai-retrieval-augmented-generation.html),\\nElsevier,
        the first of the \\\\\\\"big 5\\\\\\\" publishers has joined in! In a\\nsense
        this isn\\\\'t surprising, since Elsevier has always been protective\\nof
        their content (e.g[. they were the last of the big 5 publishers and\\none
        of the last of the major publishers that resisted making their\\ndeposited
        references in Crossref\\nOpen](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2021/02/the-era-of-open-citations-and-update-of.html)).\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n
        \ \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\nI am also not surprised by APA (which was in
        the list the earliest),\\nthough I am puzzling about JSTOR (perhaps they don\\\\'t
        have the rights)\\nand espically DataCite (I guess they are just a DOI registration
        agency\\nand don\\\\'t own content?)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n  \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\nAs
        a user and librarian I would of course prefer content owners not to\\nopt-out,
        particularly since a) only abstracts are used and not full text\\nand b) espically

        in all, I think RAG systems are something that will be here to stay\\nUNLESS
        content owners decide to block them from search systems. I\\npersonally hope
        this will not be the case.  \\n\\n  \\n\\n[\\\\#6 Primo Research Assistant
        generated answers and features can be\\nimproved]{style=\\\"font-size: 18.72px;
        font-weight: 700;\\\"}\\n\\n  \\nOf course, Primo Research Assistant is currently
        in testing and is very\\nraw and we expect to see rapid improvements as more
        feedback comes in.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n  \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\nI
        already mentioned above some of the feature limitations of Primo\\nResearch
        Assistant. It can\\\\'t parse metadata so you can search by year,\\njournal,
        you can\\\\'t do prefilters the way Scite.ai Assistant can etc.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n
        \ \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\nBut what about the actual quality of the generated
        answer? At this\\npoint, my vibes check of the system tells me that it is
        clearly showing\\npoorer results than other similar products in its class.
        \ \\n  \\nThere are multiple ways to evaluate RAG systems (with autoevaluation\\nframeworks
        like RAGAS,\_ TruLens, use of LLM as a judge etc itself a hot\\narea of study)
        but one way is to study the two components that make up\\nthe system, the
        retrieval part and the generator part seperately vs\\nstudying it end to end.\_\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n
        \ \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\nLet\\\\'s consider the generation component.

        but this is due for\\nchange.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n  \\nWhile, I have
        no doubt a more advanced model like GPT4o or GPT4o mini\\nwill help generate
        better answers hopefully with sentences that are more\\nfaithful to the cited
        papers (perhaps together with more advanced\\nprompting techniques like self-vertifications
        etc though this is\\ncostly), *one of the lessons of research on RAG is if
        the retrieval part\\ncannot surface the most relevant documents, there is
        nothing much the\\ngenerator can do.*  \\n  \\n*Unfortunately my vibe tests
        seem to indicate to me the retrieval is the\\nweakest part of the Primo Research
        Assistant currently.*  \\n  \\nWhile for generic searches where many documents
        can be considered\\nrelevant the results aren\\\\'t too bad, I find the assistant
        starting to\\nfail when there are fewer qualifying relevant documents and
        the\\nretrieval system struggles to find them and rank them in the top 5.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n

        ask it \\\\\\\"impossible\\nquestions\\\\\\\", where the system should conclude
        it is not able to find any\\ndocuments to answer the question. (In literature
        this is sometimes\\ncalled testing for [negative\\nrejection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01431))\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n
        \ \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\nMost systems will fail and try to answer something
        because the nature of\\nembedding based search is that some document must
        be \\\\\\\"closed\\\\\\\" and\\nhence for almost any query you do there will
        be some ranked results. Add\\nthe fact that LLMs have a biased to try to answer,
        they often end up\\ngenerating a plausible answer with citations but the citations
        are not\\nfaithful to the answer.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n  \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n\\nFor
        Primo Research Assistant, I notice at times it passes this test when\\nothers

        effective are research assessment reform initiatives in mobilizing\\ncollective

        Rushforth**\_and Gunnar Sivertsen*\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nRecent years have
        seen considerable growth of reform movements aiming to\\narrest perceived
        dysfunctions across science. A prominent problem that\\nhas formed the focus
        of activism in academia has been research\\nassessment practices. Multi-actor
        initiatives such as the Declaration on\\nResearch Assessment (DORA) and the
        Coalition on Advancing Research\\nAssessment (CoARA) have served as prominent
        backbone organizations for\\nthis movement, coordinating collective action
        among diverse research\\nstakeholders. As governance structures within science,
        a notable\\ncharacteristic is their reliance upon 'soft governance' and 'self\\nregulation',
        rather than incentives or coercion. In this paper we take\\nstock of how effective

        paper looks at how scientific collaboration linking universities\\nand large
        international firms fosters local invention. The first step\\naims at identifying
        the universities engaged in collaboration with large\\ncorporate entities
        belonging to the industrial sectors of\\npharmaceuticals, chemicals and biotechnology.
        After having identified\\nthe corpus of corporate publications authored by
        these enterprises we\\nanalyse in this corpus the universities engaged in
        this corporate\\nscientific collaboration allocating the co-authoring institutions
        in the\\nterritories hosting the academic authors. The extent and nature of
        the\\nuniversities' collaboration with large firms is then analysed using
        the\\nSAR model in regard to the intensity of local inventive intensity in
        the\\nmetropolitan area hosting the universities. The results show that\\ncorporate
        publications have a clear and significant effect on inventive\\noutcome and
        production.\\n\\nIncentivizing, excluding, and enduring: On the complexities

        research assessment prioritises Web of Science publications,\\naiming for
        international impact. This paper examines the policy,\\nintroduced in 2012,
        of excluding articles from journals with low impact\\nfactor or suspected
        citation inflation. We analyse how this suspension\\npolicy affected domestic
        journals and researchers' behaviour. The\\nresults show that Lithuanian researchers'
        publications in foreign\\noutlets increased, but concerns remain about the
        chosen outlets' quality\\nand potential continuing manipulation of Web of
        Science metrics. These\\nare initial findings of a broader study exploring
        policy dynamics and\\nunexpected consequences of quantitative research assessment.\\n\\nDoes
        mobility help to build bridge of collaboration between origin and\\ndestination

        **Rodrigo Costas***\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nAcademic mobility is a phenomenon
        in today's academic landscape that\\nfacilitates global collaboration and
        knowledge transfer. Despite the\\nbenefits of academic mobility, concerns
        about brain drain persist, and\\nfears of inequalities in mobility dynamics
        start to emerge. Our research\\nexplores the relationship between mobile researchers
        and the\\ncollaboration ties with their country of origin, revealing a remarkable\\ntrend:
        mobile academics maintain varying degrees of collaboration with\\ntheir origin
        countries after moving. Scholars migrating from\\nhigher-income countries
        to lower-income ones exhibit a strong\\ninclination to maintain ties with
        their highincome origins, but the\\nreverse is not observed. These findings
        suggest unequal benefits of\\nmobility regarding the collaboration ties and
        highlight the necessity\\nfor implementing policies and initiatives geared
        towards nurturing more\\nbeneficial international research collaboration and
        harnessing the\\ncontributions of mobile scientists.\\n\\nFunding flows in

        have low domestic research funding and receive a\\nsignificant portion of
        their funding from foreign sources. Consequently,\\nit is of special interest
        to understand funding flows and their\\ninfluence on African research. The
        Dimensions (Digital Science) database\\nbrings together information from publications
        and projects funded by\\nmore than 500 funding agencies from more than 40
        countries. By combining\\ngrant (project) data and funding acknowledgments
        in publications, we\\nanalyse funding flows to African countries: who are
        the main funders?\\nwhich countries and organizations do they support? what
        issues do they\\nprioritize? The study will also explore the possibilities
        and\\nlimitations of using Dimensions funding-related data for the analysis

        **Wolfgang Kaltenbrunner**, and Helen Buckley Woods*\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nThis
        short paper presents preliminary findings from a research project\\ninvestigating
        the uptake and use of so-called narrative CVs in review\\npanels for research
        funding decisions. Our analysis draws on empirical\\nmaterial collected through
        interviews and participant observation in two\\nsubsequent panel meetings
        of a funding program for early career\\nresearchers of the Dutch national
        research council NWO. As expected, we\\nfind that the recent introduction
        of a narrative CV in this program has\\nnot instantaneously transformed evaluative
        practices. Rather, the\\nemphasis on substantive narrative accounts of applicants'
        achievements,\\ncombined with the backgrounding of quantifiable evidence such
        as\\npublication counts and metrics, leads reviewers to gradually\\nproblematize
        and reconsider previously dominant definitions of quality.\\nOur analysis
        showcases exemplary situations in which such reflection\\nbecomes apparent,
        and it highlights different ways in which reviewers\\ntry to resolve newly
        underdetermined evaluative situations.\\n\\nGeography in Scientific Practice
        and Country Biases\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n***Leyan Wu**, Akrati Saxena, and
        **Vincent Traag***\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nRecent decades witnessed a steady
        increase in international scientific\\ncollaboration, alongside debates on
        nationalist tendencies in scientific\\npractices and global disparities in
        citation flows. Geographical\\nproximity has been shown to influence collaboration
        and citation rates,\\nyet how this affects global patterns remains unclear.
        Addressing this\\ngap, we examine the interplay of geography and country-level
        effects in\\ncollaboration and citations using OpenAlex data. Analysing 1.6
        million\\npublications with 6.8 million collaborations, and 3.7 million citations,\\nwe
        unveil distinct distance dependencies and country-level effects.\\nCollaborations
        between countries decline slower with distance compared\\nto intra-country
        collaborations. Surprisingly, citations between\\ncountries display lower
        distance dependence above a certain threshold,\\nwhile intra-country citations
        decrease notably. These findings suggest\\nthat geographical factors alone
        do not determine inter-country\\ncollaborations and citations, hinting at
        underlying country-level\\neffects that we will explore further in follow-up
        research. This study\\nadvances our understanding of the complex dynamics
        shaping international\\nscientific engagement.\\n\\nThe use of non-institutional

        **Nees Jan van Eck***\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nThe explosion of cases of peer
        review fraud and activities of paper\\nmills pose a systemic threat to the
        integrity of the scientific\\npublishing process. By linking the Retraction
        Watch and Web of Science\\ndatabases, metadata of retracted publications are
        analysed. In the\\nperiod 2007-2021, the use of non-institutional email addresses
        by these\\npublications' reprint authors increased by more than 20%, mainly
        due to\\nan even larger increase from authors with a postal address in India
        and\\nespecially China. Among the journals with the most retracted\\npublications,
        the use of non-institutional email addresses by reprint\\nauthors differs
        greatly: from 7 to 99%. It is also surprising that only\\n36% of the mainly
        Chinese reprint authors of the mass retracted\\npublications in Hindawi journals
        used a non-institutional email address.\\nThese results indicate that caution
        is recommended and not to\\nautomatically red-flag publications as fraudulent
        when non-institutional\\nemail addresses are used.\\n\\nDifferent representations

        Boshoff, Similo Ngwenya, Amani J. Uisso, Susanne Koch, **Rodrigo\\nCostas**,
        and **Jonathan Dudek***\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nInspired by a search for epistemic
        justice, the study examines the\\nrepresentation of Tanzanian forest science
        in five databases:\\nDimensions, OpenAlex, Scopus, Web of Science and a manually
        compiled set\\nof articles in Tanzanian journals. It also ascertains whether
        profiles\\nof three epistemic elements (alignment of research to national
        research\\npriorities, national region studied, and forest type studied) differ\\nbetween
        the databases. Initial findings of the ongoing research indicate\\nthat OpenAlex
        has the highest coverage of Tanzanian forest science\\narticles and that it
        incorporates all the forest science articles of the\\nother databases (excluding
        those in the Tanzanian dataset). In fact, 87%\\nof articles in Tanzanian journals
        do not appear in the other databases'\\nforest science collections. This is
        a form of epistemic injustice as the\\ninvisibility of large parts of forest
        science produced by Tanzanian\\nauthors collectively marginalises them and
        ultimately prevents them from\\nfully participating in scientific meaning-making.\\n\\nCoverage

        van Eck***\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nUnlike traditional proprietary data sources
        like Scopus and the Web of\\nScience (WoS), OpenAlex emphasises its comprehensiveness,
        claiming an\\nextra coverage of humanities, non-English languages, and the
        Global\\nSouth. Strengthening diversity and inclusivity in science is crucial
        for\\nethical and practical reasons. This paper analyses OpenAlex's coverage\\nand
        metadata availability of African-based publications. For this\\npurpose, OpenAlex
        is compared with Scopus, WoS, and African Journals\\nOnline (AJOL). We first
        compare the coverage of African publications in\\nOpenAlex against that of
        WoS, Scopus, and AJOL. We then assess and\\ncompare the available metadata
        for OpenAlex, Scopus, and WoS\\npublications. The analysis shows that OpenAlex
        offers the most extensive\\npublication coverage. Regarding metadata, OpenAlex
        offers a high\\ncoverage of publication and author information. It performs
        worse\\nregarding affiliations, references, and funder information. Importantly,\\nthe
        results also show that metadata availability in OpenAlex is better\\nfor publications
        also indexed in Scopus and WoS.\\n\\nUnexpected consequences of Dutch Open

        study we aim at some unintended consequences of science policy\\nregarding
        open access publishing by Dutch academics. Various actors in\\nthe system
        have advocated different forms of open access publishing, and\\nour study
        will unravel how publishing occurs in various forms of open\\naccess publishing
        (Gold versus Hybrid), and for two types of scholarly\\npublishing, the general
        output of the Netherlands and the output for\\nwhich authors located in the
        Netherlands are corresponding authors. A\\nspecial focus will be on any underlying
        field differences across the\\nDutch scholarly landscape. The study shows
        that contrary to national and\\ninternational efforts, the main focus of Dutch

        the characteristics and impact of research related\\nto the Sustainable Development
        Goals (SDGs), aiming to understand\\nspecific features of SDG-related research
        compared to non- SDG related\\nresearch. The findings reveal that SDG-research
        research, especially on\\nSDGs related to people and society (such as poverty
        alleviation,\\neducation, gender equality, and justice) are more likely to
        be cited in\\npolicy documents, indicating their relevance for public use,
        and to\\nadopt features of open science, such as open access and\\ninterdisciplinary.
        However, these publications are less likely to\\nmention funding and are less
        likely to be cited in academic publications\\ncompared to non-SDG-related
        research, suggesting a disconnect between\\npotentially more impactful research
        and academic recognition. Results\\nreveal gaps in research funding priorities

        STI research focuses on innovations in scholarly\\npublishing as a research
        object, our own scholarly communication\\npractices often rely on more traditional
        (closed) journal - based pre -\\npublication peer review. In this special
        session, we aim to discuss to\\nwhat extent this is an intentional choice,
        and in what ways we might\\nbenefit from the various affordances of open peer
        review - in particular\\nthe prospect of reusing open review reports across
        various outlets or\\ncontexts. The discussion will be prepared by four short
        pitches. First,\\nsome of the organiz ers of the preceding STI conference
        will report\\nabout experiences with open peer review in the 2023 STI iteration
        in\\nLeiden (Ludo Waltman). A second pitch will collect the existing evidence\\non
        implications of open peer review for diversity and participatio n\\n(Serge
        Horbach). A third pitch will reflect what open and portable\\nreview reports
        mean for the workings of the peer review economy in a\\npublishing context
        (Wolfgang Kaltenbrunner). Finally, there will be a\\npitch on the possibilities
        of automation in peer review and its\\nimplications for openness (Felicitas
        Hesselmann).\\n\\nThe subsequent discussion will focus on the following questions:\\n\\n-
        What are STI attendants' motivations to (not) engage in open review\\n  formats?\\n-
        What are the most important opportunities and challenges related to\\n  implementing
        open and portable peer reviews?\\n- How do open and portable reviews alter

        the past five years, the reform movements for open science and\\nresearch
        assessment have expanded significantly. Increasingly, their\\nagendas overlap
        , with champions of open science seeing current\\nassessment practices as
        incentivizing behaviours that hinder wider\\naccommodation of open science
        activities among researchers (UNESCO,\\n2021, Nosek, 2019, Spector, 2022)
        . Reform of academic career assessment\\nsystems is often earmarked as a site
        through which to incentivize\\nacademics to more fully embrace open ways of
        working (e.g. EC, 2017,\\nMustajoki et al., 2021, Pietil\xE4 et al., 2023,
        M\xE9ndez and S\xE1nchez -\\nN\xFA\xF1ez, 2023) . It is of course easy to
        say that researchers in general\\nshould be 'recognized' and 'rewarded' for
        open science (in its various\\nincarnations) . But what might this look like
        in practice, what has\\nactually been tried out so far, how might researchers
        in their roles as\\nevaluators and producers of knowledge respond to such
        steering efforts,\\nand what might be the consequences for career evaluations

        Abstract\\n\\nOver the past decade, there has been a significant increase
        in the\\nnumber of bibliometric analyses published in the peer - reviewed\\nliterature,
        particularly outside of library and information science\\nwhere bibliometric
        s is traditionally situated. While diversity has\\nalways been a strength,
        it also poses challenges in ensuring quality.\\nThe variability in reporting
        quality we currently see may, at least\\npartially, be grounded in the lack
        of guidance on how to conduct and\\nreport bibliometric studies by experts
        from within the field. This\\nspecial session will engage the community in
        a discussion about quality\\nand reporting of bibliometric analyses. Our session
        relates to the\\nconference theme of \\\"Into the great wide open?\\\" in
        that the level of\\nopenness in the bibliometrics community -- our methods
        and analytical\\ntools, the application of our work, our disciplinary backgrounds,
        and\\nincreasingly more often our data sources -- have given rise to a\\nchallenge
        in ensuring the quality of our work and the integrity of the\\nfield. The

        Hill, Moumita Koley, Cameron\\nNeylon, James Wilsdon*\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nThe
        trans-national reform movement for responsible research assessment\\nis growing
        considerably. As part of this, there is increasing interest\\nin monitoring
        and evaluating research cultures and environments (RCE)\\nwithin national,
        program and institutional assessment processes. Moving\\nfrom broad aspirations
        to workable, transparent and legitimate\\nevaluation practices is not however
        straightforward. Meeting these\\ndemands will necessitate relevant, trusted
        and reliable indicators, that\\ncan provide the robustness of evidence needed
        for monitoring and\\nevaluation. Rapidly unfolding developments around RCE
        indicators thus\\nmerit urgent attention from experts within the STI community.
        The aim of\\nthis special session is to bring together researchers and practitioners\\nto
        debate urgent questions over emerging RCE indicators, draw out\\nimportant
        lessons, and compare experiences a cross research systems.\\n\\nThe format
        will consist of short presentations from invited experts from\\nthe Research
        on Research Institute's AgoRRA RCE workstream and audience\\nQ&A. Speakers
        will share insider accounts of the latest policy\\ndevelopments, debates and
        controversies in their respective national\\nresearch systems, and to draw
        out technical and social issues RCE\\ndevelopments are throwing up. These
        include methodological questions\\nover indicator design and data needs, potential
        disagreements over what\\nto evaluate, resourcing, and opposition by some
        research system\\nstakeholders.\\n\\nDiscussion for the proposed new strategy

        Sivertsen, **Ludo Waltman**, Lin Zhang, **Andr\xE9 Brasil***\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\n*Background*
        \ \\nIn its proposal for a new strategy, \\\\\\\"Towards responsible publishing\\\\\\\"
        ,\\ncOAlition S summarizes: \\\"In the five years that have elapsed since
        the\\npublication of the Plan S principles, the move toward full and immediate\\nOpen
        Access (OA) has become global and irreversible.\\\" However, \\\"this has\\nbeen
        delivered through business models -- such as Read and Publish\\nagreements
        and APCs -- which are highly inequitable\\\". The coalition now\\nenvisages
        a \\\"scholar-led\\\" and \\\"community-based\\\" scholarly communication\\nsystem
        \\\"without author-facing charges\\\". Furthermore, the general OA\\nambition
        of Plan S is \\\"extended to include all scholarly outputs, such\\nas preprints
        and peer review reports\\\" because \\\"the current practice of\\npre-publication
        peer review needlessly delays the sharing of research\\noutputs\\\".\\n\\n*Session
        Goals*  \\nThe aim of the session is to discuss the new focuses and priorities
        of\\nCoalition S based on experiences so far -- including evidence provided\\nby
        the areas of research contributing to the STI conferences. Three\\ntopics
        will be prepared for short introductions to start discussions\\nwith the audience:\\n\\n1.
        \ Empirical examination of the OA transformation so far: The\\n    discussion
        will focus on the empirical evidence pertaining to the\\n    transition into
        Open Access publishing in recent years. A core\\n    question will be how
        the transition aligns with the traditional\\n    research policy criteria
        of research quality and affordability.\\n2.  Challenges with changing the
        market of scientific publishing: The\\n    discussion will focus on new initiatives
        for scholarly publishing,\\n    their foundation and implementation issues,
        in particular the vision\\n    of a \\\"scholar-led\\\" and \\\"community-based\\\"
        scholarly communication\\n    system \\\"without author-facing charges\\\".
        To what degree are the\\n    trends in the present market of scientific publishing
        aligned with\\n    these principles, and how can they be fully aligned?\\n3.
        \ Exploration of change trajectories for editorial practices: What are\\n
        \   the experiences so far with alternatives to pre-publication peer\\n    review,
        and how do they align with the plurality of existing\\n    community-based
        efforts, including disciplinary differences?\\n\\nMethodological approaches
        to capture knowledge flows between research\\nand public policy: the role
        of open sources and inequalities in the\\nspotlight\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n*Sergio
        Salles-Filho, Evandro Coggo Cristofoletti, **Rodrigo Costas**,\\n**Ed Noyons**,
        **Biegzat Murat**, and Cassidy Sugimoto*\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nIn today\\\\'s
        rapidly evolving social landscape, which encompasses\\ncritical issues such
        as climate change, poverty, and technological\\nadvancements, the intersection
        of policy and science holds paramount\\nsignificance. Understanding how research
        informs and shapes policy\\ndecisions has become increasingly crucial, sparking
        discussions on\\nmethodologies for assessing impact. While tools like Overton
        and\\nAltmetric.com have gained popularity, they do not provide neither enough\\ncoverture,
        nor open data, presenting two significant challenges:\\nestablishing open
        - access sources for policy documents and bridging the\\ncoverage gaps between
        the Global South and the Global North. The special\\nsession aims to address
        two specific interests: (i) exploring the\\ndifferences and synergies between
        open and proprietary data sources of\\npolicy documents, and (ii) examining
        the disparities in coverage between\\nthe Global South and Global North regarding
        policy documents and related\\nscholarly outputs within these data sources.
        The proposal aims to foster\\ndebate on potential methodologies for leveraging
        open sources of policy\\ndocuments and for identifying and analyzing inequalities
        in accessing\\nresearch impact on policy. Furthermore, the session seeks to
        explore\\nstrategies for overcoming these inequalities and enhancing the\\nsignificance
        of open data sources in the process.\\n\\nThe session\\\\'s dynamics will
        involve brief speeches from invited guests,\\napproximately 10 minutes each,
        forming a debate panel. Audience\\nparticipation will be encouraged through
        commenting or making questions\\non the topic.\\n\\n### GLOBAL consensus\_meeting\\n\\n[Right

        to\\ninternational medical graduates (IMGs) hoping to attain medical\\nresidency
        in the United States. These publications will hypothetically\\nbeef up the
        customer's CV and increase their chances of being matched.  \\n  \\nMany such
        businesses are based in the United States. They mostly follow\\nvariations
        on the same playbook: for a hefty sum (often around 1,000\\nUSD), the customer
        can attend an online course (often meeting once a\\nweek for an hour for four
        to eight weeks), after which their name will\\nbe on one to five meeting abstracts
        or articles in the \\\"peer reviewed\\\"\\nand indexed literature.\\n\\nHassaan

        offers courses matching this pattern where customers will obtain\\none published
        paper as first author, four published papers as middle\\nauthor, a letter
        of recommendation, a certificate of completion, and\\npermission to list CIBNP
        as an institutional affiliation for two years.\\n\\nIs eight hours of instruction
        enough for someone to make a genuine\\ncontribution to five research papers?
        I would contend not, but that\\ndoesn't seem to matter to the people selling
        these courses. Often, the\\nmain selling point isn't training, but clout.

        article in the future.\\n>\\n> Our students are young doctors, and your mocking
        and criticism can\\n> destroy their confidence and self-esteem and they may
        give up and stop\\n> writing in the future.\\n>\\n> Many of our students don't
        produce highest quality of articles but we\\n> still appreciate our students
        and love them unconditionally.\\n>\\n> We teach our students honesty, and
        integrity, and educate them about\\n> the importance of truth and honesty.
        Yet it is also possible that any\\n> of our students lies or fabricates data
        in the paper deliberately.\\n> Therefore, we CiBNP hold no responsibility
        of the content of the\\n> article produced. We teach the students the importance
        of honesty and\\n> integrity and if they still don't listen to us and make
        intentional\\n> mistakes or fabricate the data, and submit to a journal and\\n>
        accidentally the journal reviewers missed the mistakes and journal\\n> publishes
        that article, then the student is himself/herself\\n> responsible.\\n>\\n>
        Just like a medical school that trains students to become doctors and\\n>
        if the same student becomes a corrupt doctor or harms the patient\\n> deliberately
        or unintentionally, is the medical school responsible?\\n> Similarly, when
        a building or a bridge collapses due to bad\\n> calculations by the civil
        engineers, should we hold the engineering\\n> university responsible? The
        obvious answer is NO.\\n>\\n> Similarly, if our students who learned the skill

        fraud or fabrication\\n> of data, should we be responsible? For this reason
        we don't take\\n> responsibility of the scientific content and our students

        CiBNP and its faculty can only teach and guide but are not responsible\\n>
        for the content, fabrication, or deception or lies of any kind, the\\n> content
        is solely Students' responsibility.\\n\\nAs you might guess from this disclaimer
        absolving CIBNP from any of its\\nstudent's errors or misconduct, the publications
        produced by these\\ntraining programs are often not very good. I've included
        an updating\\nlist of select PubPeer threads for articles originating from
        these\\nbusinesses at the bottom of this post.\\n\\nThe global landscape of
        medical training is exceptionally unequal and\\nhyper-competitive. Within
        this system, dozens of businesses have emerged\\nto prey on aspiring doctors
        from the Global South, litter the medical\\nliterature with low-quality and
        fraudulent studies, and throw these\\ndoctors under the bus when the backlash
        begins. While some of these\\nbusinesses may have helped a handful of doctors
        to surmount the high\\nwalls surrounding the United States medical system,
        the for-profit\\nnature of these businesses ensures this privilege is only
        available to\\nthose that can pay, perpetuating the same inequality that these\\nbusinesses
        claim to fight. CIBNP is right; the victims of these\\nbusinesses deserve
        our compassion, not our scorn.\\n\\nAs long as global economies of scientific
        and medical research remain\\nhighly stratified and cutthroat, paper mills
        will continue to\\nmaterialize to exploit these ills and the people most vulnerable
        to\\nthem.\\n\\n#### Selected publications from IMG-targeting paper mills

        Image\\nLibrary.</a></em></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nBecause cell lines
        can grow indefinitely, one research laboratory or\\nlaboratory supplier can
        take a few cells from their cell line stock and\\ngive them to another laboratory
        for that laboratory to begin culturing\\ntheir own stock. By far the most
        popular cell line is\\n[HeLa](https://www.cellosaurus.org/CVCL_0030), and
        the many of thousands\\nof HeLa cell stocks used in biomedical research around
        the world can all\\nbe traced back to the original stock of \\\"immortal\\\"
        cervical cancer cells\\ntaken from [Henrietta Lacks in\\n1951](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Lacks).\\n\\nOne
        complication of relying on cell lines for biomedical research is\\nthat stocks
        will often become cross-contaminated by other cell lines.\\nFor instance,
        HeLa is extremely aggressive as cancer cell lines go and\\nHeLa cells will
        easily overtake other cell line stocks that are stored\\nnearby. The popular
        gastric cancer cell line\\n[BGC-823](https://www.cellosaurus.org/CVCL_3360)
        is one such victim of\\nHeLa's aggression; there are no remaining uncontaminated
        stocks of\\nBGC-823 and thus it is no longer considered an appropriate experimental\\nmodel
        for gastric cancer. The International Cell Line Authentication\\nCommittee
        maintains [a register of misidentified cell\\nlines](https://iclac.org/databases/cross-contaminations/)
        that is\\ncurrently 582 entries long. A good number of these cell lines were\\ncontaminated
        by cells from a completely different organism, such as\\nhuman salivary gland
        cell line\\n[CAC2](https://www.cellosaurus.org/CVCL_6883), which is actually
        made up\\nof unknown cells from a rat.\\n\\nBecause [different cell lines
        can have a wide variety of responses to\\nthe same\\ntreatment](https://www.cancerrxgene.org/compound/Paclitaxel/11/overview/ic50),\\nit
        is essential that researchers avoid misidentified cell lines and only\\nwork
        with authenticated cell lines that actually represent their system\\nof interest.\\n\\n<figure

        \\\\[UPDATE: May\\n16, 2024\\\\] [now published in the *International Journal
        of\\nCancer*](https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.34995), we can now report on a\\nwhole
        new threat to biomedical research: cell lines that never existed\\nin the
        first place.\\n\\nThe names of cell lines are usually just a jumble of letters
        and numbers\\nand thus can often be easily confused. For instance, the name
        of BGC-823\\nis very similar to that of\\n[MGC-803](https://www.cellosaurus.org/CVCL_5334),
        another misidentified\\ngastric cancer cell line. One might easily misspell
        these cell lines as\\n\\\"BGC-803\\\" or \\\"MGC-823\\\". However, we noticed
        that sometimes these\\nmisspelled identifiers were used to refer to another
        cell line entirely\\ndistinct from these existing cell lines. Take the 2021
        article [\\\"Long\\nnon-coding RNA KCNQ1OT1 promotes the progression of gastric
        cancer via\\nthe miR-145-5p/ARF6 axis\\\"](https://doi.org/10.1002/jgm.3330)
        in the\\n*Journal of Gene Medicine* (Wiley), which refers to experiments in
        cell\\nlines \\\"BGC-803\\\" and \\\"BSG-823\\\" in addition to experiments
        in the\\ncontaminated cell lines BGC-823 and MGC-803.\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        B. Aggarwal is an Indian-American biochemist who worked at MD\\nAnderson Cancer
        Center from 1989 to 2015. His research focused on\\npotential anti-cancer
        effects and therapeutic applications of herbs and\\nspices. Aggarwal was particularly
        drawn to curcumin, a non-toxic\\ncompound found in turmeric that has long
        been staple in Ayurvedic\\nsystems of medicine. He authored more than 120
        articles about the\\ncompound from 1994 to 2020. These articles reported that
        curcumin had\\ntherapeutic potential for a variety of diseases, including
        various\\ncancers, Alzheimer's disease and, more recently, COVID-19. In his

        Anderson Cancer Center initially appeared to be fully on board with\\nAggarwal's

        Cancer Center\\nlaunched a research fraud probe against Aggarwal which eventually
        led to\\n30 of Aggarwal's articles being retracted. Only some of these studies\\nwere
        about curcumin specifically, but most concerned similar natural\\nproducts.\\n\\nRetractions

        making false claims about the health effects of these supplements.\\n\\nCurcumin
        is a valuable case study in how unimpeded fraud can distort an\\nentire research
        field to the detriment of genuine research. Despite\\nindications that Aggarwal's
        research on curcumin ought not to be\\nconsidered reliable, a majority of
        articles and an even greater majority\\nof NIH-funded studies about curcumin
        still cite Aggarwal's work. It\\nseems unlikely that this explosion in funding
        and research would have\\nmaterialized if Aggarwal had not engaged in large-scale
        research fraud.\\n\\nScientific fraud, especially at this scale, is alarming.
        However, there\\nis a common refrain that instances like this are an exceedingly
        rare,\\ninsular threat and that any harm done to human knowledge by them will\\ninevitably
        be neutralized by science's remarkable tendency for\\nself-correction. Once
        the history books are written, these instances\\nwill be little more than
        footnotes, parked between [the Bates\\nmethod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bates_method)
        and\\n[orgone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgone).\\n\\nHowever, self-correction
        has a high cost in the present: hundreds of\\nmillions of taxpayer dollars,
        countless hours spent toiling by junior\\nscientists, thousands of laboratory
        animals sacrificed, thousands of\\ncancer patients enrolled in clinical trials
        for ineffective treatments,\\nand countless people who have eschewed expensive
        and invasive but\\neffective cancer treatment in favor of a store-bought spice,
        encouraged\\nby research steeped in lies.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/mtd0v-mz025\",\"guid\":\"http://reeserichardson.blog/?p=71\",\"id\":\"240916ed-fb7a-4fc8-a868-b2a057e9ea30\",\"image\":\"https://reeserichardson.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/curcumin_and_turmeric.png?w=1024\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1706623200,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"rid\":\"qxt7w-jd602\",\"status\":\"active\",\"summary\":\"Bharat
