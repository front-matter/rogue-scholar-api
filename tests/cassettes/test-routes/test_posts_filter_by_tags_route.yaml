        you may have seen in the <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/22/personal-data-stolen-in-british-library-cyber-attack-appears-for-sale-online\\\">news</a>,
        the British Library has been affected by a significant cyberattack. Many of
        the digital services it provides have gone down and stayed down for many weeks
        now, whilst investigations take place. I have a lot of sympathy for the BL
        staff. As has been <a href=\\\"https://hcommons.social/@mia/111483661298025928\\\">observed</a>,
        public services can be a relatively easy target.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Two of
        the very wide variety of digital services that the BL provide, that I have
        a particular interest in are:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>a) the ISSN National Centre
        for the UK: <a href=\\\"https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html\\\">https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html</a><br>b)
        the E-Theses Online Service (EThOS): <a href=\\\"http://ethos.bl.uk/\\\">http://ethos.bl.uk/</a>
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Both of these services, and many others (do we even know
        how many?) are still offline at the time of writing this (2023-11-30). I can
        probably live without registering a new ISSN, that can wait. But what about
        access to my PhD thesis? I want people to be able to read this. Is it still
        available online anywhere? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>My thesis EThOS ID is: uk.bl.ethos.64202
        . In more normal times it would be publicly available via this link: <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022\\\">https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022</a>
        <br><br>Fortunately, because I retained my rights to it, my thesis is openly-licensed
        under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 licence, and copies of it can be
        uploaded wherever I want. As a consequence, my thesis is also available from
        the <a href=\\\"https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/comparative-cladistics-fossils-morphological-data-partitions-and-\\\">University

        Archive</a>. Even if one or two of these repositories goes down, it&#8217;s
        highly likely that my thesis will always be accessible from somewhere on the
        internet 24/7, no matter what. Posting content in multiple independently-run
        places gives others access to that content in a highly <em>resilient</em>
        way. It is also worth mentioning, there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0165551510389358\\\">study</a>
        suggesting that OA content made available in multiple places gets cited more
        than OA content only available in one place.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        got me thinking again about the major &#8216;Atyponocalypse&#8217; downtime
        event of 17th December 2020. Do you remember it? I certainly do (the screenshot
        above is from that event). The journal hosting platforms of SAGE, ACS Publications,
        Wiley, Taylor &amp; Francis and many others all simultaneously went offline
        for roughly a 24 hour period because of an error at <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon\\\">Atypon</a>,
        the publishing platform that many different legacy publishers use. It was
        unprecedented. People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of important
        knowledge were made almost completely digitally unavailable, worldwide. I
        like how <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185\\\">Brie</a>
        put it, at the time:<br><br>&#8220;One day left for student finals and Wiley&#8217;s
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites are all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and consolidations of academic knowledge again?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click\\\">#WileyDown</a>&#8221;
        (and that was the numbers for just <em>one</em> publisher)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        interesting thing about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for much of
        the content affected, there was no alternative, legal platform hosting the
        content in parallel.  Nor could people put online temporary copies to help
        students and researchers access the content they urgently needed &#8211; because
        of the copyright restrictions on that content. Many of the legacy publishers,
        for their paywalled journals (only), still have this major single-point-of-failure
        weakness.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But open access content does NOT suffer these
        weaknesses.<br><br>As I allude to in the title of this post. The key differentiators
        here in open access systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime
        overall are a) availability on multiple independent platforms and b) open
        licencing that makes it legally easier to host content in multiple places.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tools
        such as Google Scholar, <a href=\\\"https://openalex.org/\\\">OpenAlex</a>,
        and <a href=\\\"https://www.base-search.net/\\\">BASE</a> can signpost the
        way to where these alternative copies live. Research can stay openly accessible
        24/7, 365 days a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed and thus easy
        to host on multiple platforms.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Even if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g. <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/\\\">Michigan</a>
        recently) experience some downtime through cyberattacks or &#8216;unplanned
        maintainence&#8217;, the global collective network of repositories can ensure
        that the scholarship remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different locations.
        \ <strong>The next time you see a paywalled journal experiencing some significant
        downtime, please let me know.</strong> I think there are some very interesting
        natural obervation experiments that could be done around these events to tease
        out the differences in impact between open-licensed and &#8216;all rights
        reserved&#8217; content.  Does anyone maintain a wiki or database of major
        downtime events at academic publishers? There have been quite a few already&#8230;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        marking a turning point by providing a disruptive and free and open alternative
        to earlier sources such as Google Scholar, which provided freely accessible

        ones, which showed its coverage approaching parity with those of the other
        sources involved in the analysis (Microsoft Academic, Scopus, Dimensions,
        and Web of Science). At the time of its most recent update in January 2023,
        COCI counted more than 1.4 billion citations. The reason behind this outstanding
        number lies in several factors, including </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/1165\\\"><span

        of heart, in 2019 OpenCitations had tried to narrow the open citations coverage
        gap by launching its second index, the </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/944\\\"><span

        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">In
        December 2022, a new concrete step towards a factual plurality of OpenCitations
        indexes was taken by the ingestion of new data sources into the infrastructure,
        with the publication of the inaugural dumps of </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/3106\\\"><b>DOCI

        and new challenges</b></h4>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">While having such a variety and richness of
        indexes helped present the extent of OpenCitations sources, the recent </span><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">increment in the number of sources and the
        diversification of data integrated led to two primary </span><b>issues</b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">: </span></p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n<li style=\\\"list-style-type:

        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">Moreover,
        it soon became evident the need to optimize the reuse of the already developed
        software components </span><b>to facilitate the metadata crosswalk processes
        between the new sources\u2019 data models and the OpenCitations Data Model</b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">, with </span><b>the aim to define a functional
        and easily extendable workflow</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\"> to
        be easily reused when it comes to incorporating new data sources, which should
        be:\_</span></p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n<li style=\\\"list-style-type: none\\\">\\r\\n<ol

        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">sufficiently generic to establish a globally
        unique procedure;\_</span></li>\\r\\n<li><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">customizable
        enough to capture the necessary information within each of the specific data
        models and formats.\_</span></li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">As
        a solution, we decided to use </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/3140\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">OpenCitations Meta</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">, the new OpenCitations database and tool for managing bibliographic
        data related to the publications involved in the citations. OpenCitations
        Meta makes it possible to assign each entity involved in a citation an internal
        identifier, nominally the OpenCitations Meta Identifier (OMID), to which all
        the associated persistent identifiers of the same publication are redirected.</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">As
        a result, the allocation of an OMID for each bibliographic resource also enabled
        the unambiguous identification of each citation, regardless of the persistent
        identifier schema originally used by the data source to identify the resources.
        This approach allowed us to perform data deduplication and finally make all
        the sources\u2019 contributions converge into </span><b>a unified index containing
        all the unique citations managed by OpenCitations, expressed as OMID to OMID
        citation links.</b></p>\\r\\n<h4 style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><b>The
        revised workflow</b></h4>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">The new workflow is based on </span><b>three
        main components</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\"> with the </span><b>benefit
        </b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">of optimizing the process both in
        terms of computational cost and in terms of flexibility. As shown in Fig.
        1, in a preliminary step, source-specific software converts the input dataset
        &#8211; structured according to the source data model &#8211; to extract two
        OpenCitations Data Model compliant data collections in tabular format for
        bibliographic metadata and citation data, respectively.</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">The
        following steps are common to the process of each dataset.\_\_</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><b>STEP 1</b><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">: The bibliographic metadata collection is used as input for the META
        software. At this stage, it is checked whether or not the bibliographic entities
        have been previously integrated into our infrastructure (coming from other
        data sources). If so, the existing OMID is linked also to the new alternative
        identifiers of the new bibliographic resources. New metadata values, if any,
        are also integrated. A new OMID identifier is produced for entities never
        previously encountered, uniquely representing the bibliographic resource in
        OpenCitations. The outputs of the process are: (I) an updated version of the
        OpenCitations Meta collection that also includes the metadata of the bibliographic
        entities provided by the new source, and (II) a collection of provenance data.
        An internal database is constantly refreshed to preserve correspondence between
        IDs and the associated internal OMIDs.</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:
        justify\\\"><b>STEP 2</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">: Starting from
        the collection of citations expressed as directional links between identifiers
        of potentially any type (e.g., DOI-DOI, PMID-PMID, PMC-PMID, etc.), the INDEX
        software queries the internal database mapping IDs to OMIDs to produce an
        updated version of the OpenCitations Index: unique citations expressed as
        OMID-OMID links in different formats, accompanied by their corresponding provenance
        data.</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\"

        deeply insufficient. I won&#8217;t reveal for which open access journal I
        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose

        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,
        and <em>PCI Registered Reports</em> is one of the communities that will provide
        that service for you, for free! </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would love to see more
        stage 1 registered reports in metaresearch, to catch improperly designed studies
        before they get carried out, written-up, and submitted. Reducing research

        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus

        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        there was clear focus on BioBanking at the GGBN conference, I was additionally
        interested to hear that GGBN standards are useful from a rewilding perspective.
        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental

        --*Sir David Attenborough, Sept 30th 2020*\\n\\nThe fourth international [Global
        Genome Biodiversity Network (GGBN)\\nConference](https://ggbn2023.weebly.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer

        Aguascalientes. The\\n[GGBN](https://www.ggbn.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"}\\nis a global network of collections of genomic
        samples from across the\\nTree of Life, whose mission is to foster collaborations
        among\\nbiodiversity and biobanking repositories in order to ensure quality\\nstandards
        and harmonise exchange of material in accordance with national\\nand international
        legislation and conventions. GigaScience Press Data\\nScientist Chris Armit
        attended the conference and reports below on some\\nof the highlights.\\n\\n###
        **Confronting the Global Decline in Biodiversity: The GGBN Perspective** {#confronting-the-global-decline-in-biodiversity-the-ggbn-perspective
        .wp-block-heading}\\n\\n**Oliver Ryder** (San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance
        IUCN-SSC Animal\\nBiobanking for Conservation Specialist Group, and [co-founder
        of\\nGenome10K](https://doi.org/10.1186/2047-217X-3-32){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer

        noopener\\\"}) introduced the Biodiversity Crisis with some\\ndizzying statistics.
        A study of 31,821 populations representing 5,230\\nspecies monitored across
        the globe showed a 69% decline in abundance.\\nThe decline is disproportionate
        across the globe with the megadiverse\\ncontinent of Africa showing a 66%
        reduction in biodiversity, and Latin\\nAmerica and the Caribbean showing a
        staggering 94% reduction in\\nbiodiversity. The message is clear -- we have
        to act now to conserve our\\nliving planet.\\n\\nConservation is a key focus
        of the GGBN, and this network -- coordinated\\nby the GGBN Secretariat hosted
        and supported by the National Museum of\\nNatural History, Smithsonian Institution,
        Washington, DC -- aims to\\nprovide the necessary Data Standards for BioBanked
        specimens in a global\\ncontext.\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image is-resized\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/UjgoqbzgJ_WcABy1q1hJW1PmZ73gnK-MJWkLvW7nKqusRmnNH_yXEP-7UeLp_Lv47_S0HH_mEe9jxAIa7Nq7hbD90mtFYc9nApbUc75GfAjtmE1BmVt-BCSCJdJCLLedfDtLVPExr2C4XrsR5H5NgCA\\\"\\ndecoding=\\\"async\\\"

        Biobanking for\\nConservation.*\\n\\nThe term 'Data Standards' is used to
        describe a set of terms and\\ncontrolled vocabularies designed to represent
        facts about a\\nsample/voucher. An additional important concept pertinent
        to the focus\\nof GGBN is the \\\"Digital Extended Specimen\\\", which is
        a cloud of\\ninformation around a vouchered specimen and which can include
        genomic\\nsequence data and metabolomics data.\\n\\n### **One Plan Approach**
        {#one-plan-approach .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nIn his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder
        highlighted the need for a common\\nstandard of good practice and information
        sharing. Towards this end,\\nOliver showcased the \\\"One Plan Approach\\\"
        which was formulated at the\\nIUCN World Conservation Congress 2020 at its
        session in Marseille,\\nFrance, and which \\\"urges the Secretariat and professional
        societies to\\npromote integration of *in situ* and *ex situ* conservation\\ninterventions\\\"
        and \\\"to ensure effective use of all available\\nconservation tools\\\".\\n\\nOf
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN\\nCommissions and
        Members to \\\"enable and support establishment of a global\\nnetwork of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species\\nconservation targets and
        operating to common standards of good practice\\nand information sharing.\\\"\\n\\n###
        **Genetic Rescue and Cloning** {#genetic-rescue-and-cloning .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nOliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost\\namongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue\\ninvolves an increase
        in fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated\\nindividuals into small,
        declining populations, and we have [explored\\nthis topic\\npreviously](http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"} with our publication of the genome of the\\ncritically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver\\nhighlighted how genetic rescue
        has been successful in [increasing the\\nfitness of the Florida\\npanther](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"} *Puma* *concolor coryi*, by moving female\\npanthers from Texas
        to Florida from the mid-1990s.\\n\\nMuch more technically challenging is the
        use of cloning to increase\\ngenetic fitness in endangered species. Oliver
        was swift to point out\\nthat this approach has been used for the critically
        endangered\\nPrzewalski's horse. The [first cloned *Equus\\nprzewalskii*](https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"} was foaled on August 6th 2020 and was named\\n'Kurt' in honour
        of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke of\\nSan Diego Zoo.\\n\\nIn
        the same year, a black-footed ferret named 'Elizabeth Ann' (born\\nDecember
        10, 2020) was [the first U.S. endangered species to be\\ncloned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"}. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen\\ncells from Willa,
        a black-footed female ferret who died in the 1980s and\\nwho had no living

        .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nA core focus of the GGBN conference was cryobanking
        of viable cells and\\ngametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking, **Jackie\\nMackenzie-Dodds**
        (Natural History Museum, London) referred to the\\ncryopreservation facilities
        as a \\\"treasure trove of molecules\\\". Jackie\\npointed out that viable
        cell lines are the most requested resource for\\nthe Natural History Museum
        BioBank, where they are used for the\\ngeneration of induced pluripotent stem
        cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.\\n\\nAnother important message from the GGBN
        conference was the need for Open\\nAccess BioBank facilities. Towards this
        end, an additional incentive for\\nresearchers and curators was provided by
        **Mudzuli Mavhunga** of\\nBiodiversity Biobanks South Africa (South African
        National Biodiversity\\nInstitute, Pretoria). Mudzuli highlighted that, if
        a South African\\nBioBank is awarded the status of Open Access, then it is
        eligible for\\nresource allocations through Biodiversity Biobanks South Africa
        (BBSA),\\nwhich is a great asset for a collection facility.\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        **Scalability of Cloning** {#scalability-of-cloning .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nSo
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? **Ben\\nNovak**
        of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk\\nentitled \\\"Important
        Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of\\nEndangered Species\\\",
        highlighted the example of passerines (perching\\nbirds) where programmed
        DNA loss is observed in some species. In\\npasserines such as the zebra finch
        (*Taeniopygia guttata*), there is a\\n[germ-line-restricted\\nchromosome](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"} -- known as an accessory chromosome -- that\\nis present in
        the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently [lost\\nduring male\\nmeiosis](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer

        is represented exclusively in the germ cells, and is\\nabsent from somatic
        cells of the [bone\\nmarrow](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer

        species,\\nand can occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of\\nchromosome
        regions and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes.\\nHowever, this
        phenomenon, if observed in somatic tissues, can severely\\nimpact on the ability

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \\\"which tissues\\nto

        line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is\\none means
        of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted\\nchromosomes in the cryopreservation
        of endangered species. The\\nalternative is to cryopreserve reproductive tissues.\\n\\n###
        **Cryopreservation for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues** {#cryopreservation-for-biobanking-of-gametes-and-reproductive-tissues
        .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nOn the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive
        tissues, invaluable\\ninsights were provided by **Tullis Matson** of [Nature's\\nSAFE](https://www.natures-safe.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"}, whose mission is to combat extinction by\\ncollecting, indefinitely
        storing and regenerating reproductive cells and\\ncell lines from endangered

        equine breeds,\\nincluding the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for which
        there are\\nonly 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis\\nhas created Nature's SAFE with the intention of applying this know-how\\nof
        rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been on\\nfield
        trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An\\nimportant
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South\\nAfrica stay in
        South Africa, which is both an ethical and legal\\nobligation (see Sharing
        of Genomic Collections under the Nagoya Protocol\\nbelow).\\n\\nTullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal\\nsamples, and the role
        of Nature's SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian\\ntissue from the pied tamarin
        (*Saguinus bicolor*, critically\\nendangered), the lar gibbon (*Hylobates
        lar*, endangered), and the\\ncheetah (*Acinonyx jubatus*, vulnerable). As
        Tullis explained, \\\"working\\nwith leading reproductive scientists and cryobiologists,
        we use\\nstate-of-the-art methods to preserve cells in a way that maintains\\nviability,
        allowing them to be thawed and used to establish pregnancies,\\nrestoring

        which aims at sharing the benefits arising from\\nthe utilisation of genetic
        resources in a fair and equitable way. One of\\nthe key features of the Nagoya
        Protocol agreement is that a permit is\\nrequired for gathering a specimen.

        makes the consolidation even more extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers
        went from 47% of the market in 2000 to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest

        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access
        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such
        policies. The whole system rests on this logic of extraction and that&#8217;s
        what needs to be opposed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"Today's

        found that it&#8217;s a struggle to get people&#8217;s interest and that we
        have to be creative in order to educate about OA issues. Part of what I suspect
        makes advocating for OA difficult is the sort of singularity that comes from
        being &#8220;just the library,&#8221; the group that&#8217;s always talking
        about it. So when this Open Science Working Group formed, I was excited about

        on open science</a> in 2022. Later they established the working group by inviting
        people to participate in a workshop (there were over 20 people representing
        many disciplines). The workshop operated through a modified form of DORA&#8217;s
        <a href=\\\"https://sfdora.org/resource/workshop-toolkit-to-introduce-the-space-rubric/\\\">SPACE

        end of the process. Among other things, next steps include focused discussions
        with department heads, administrators, and others. I imagine that getting

        und Gesch\xE4ftsmodelle abseits von Publikationsgeb\xFChren\\n(Article Processing
        Charges, APCs) legt und ob sogar eine Abkehr von der\\nUnterst\xFCtzung dieses
        Modells durch die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa betont\\nwird.\\n\\nSchweden
        hatte das Thema im Rahmen seiner EU-Ratspr\xE4sidentschaft\\naugegriffen und
        bereits im\\n[Februar](https://wisspub.net/2023/02/10/eu-wissenschaftsministerien-erortern-open-science/)\\nin
        einem Hintergrund-Papier adressiert. Schon in diesem Briefing Paper\\nwurde
        die Problematik steigender Preise f\xFCr die wissenschaftlichen\\nFachinformation
        betont.\_\\n\\nIn der jetzt verabschiedeten Version der Schlussfolgerungen
        die\\nForderung nach sofortigem Open Access f\xFCr wissenschaftliche\\nPublikationen,
        die im Rahmen der \xF6ffentlich gef\xF6rderten Forschung\\nentstehen, nochmals
        betont. Dieses Ziel wurde [bereits\\n2016](https://wisspub.net/2016/05/27/eu-und-g7-staaten-setzen-auf-open-science/)\\nvon
        den EU-Wissenschaftsministerien erhoben. Die\\nWissenschaftsminister:innen
        hatten damals einen Open-Access-Anteil von\\n100 % bis 2020 gefordert. Dieser
        Wert wurde bisher jedoch nicht\\nerreicht. In Deutschland liegt der Open-Access-Anteil
        zum Beispiel bei\\n[63](https://open-access-monitor.de/) Prozent, w\xE4hrend
        die Niederlande\\nim Publikationsjahr 2021 einen Anteil von\\n[82](https://www.openaccess.nl/en/in-the-netherlands/monitor)\_Prozent\\nerreichten.\\n\\n:::

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im\\nBereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen\\nbetont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und\\nFinanzierungsmodellen, die
        weder die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen\\nfinanziell belasten und sich
        durch angemessene und transparente Preise\\nauszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird
        beklagt, dass die steigenden Preise f\xFCr\\nwissenschaftliche Fachinformationen
        zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren und die\\n\xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil
        der Forschung belasten (Punkt\\n5).\\n\\nAufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen
        Verlagswesen wird in zwei\\nbemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung
        von nicht\\ngewinnorientierten Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:\\n\\n\\\"The
        Council of the European Union \\\\[...\\\\] highlights the importance of\\nnot-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not\\ncharge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their\\nwork without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the\\nvariety of models that do not depend on
        article processing charges or\\nsimilar per-unit charges and stresses the
        importance of supporting the\\ndevelopment of such models led by public research
        organisations; \\\\[...\\\\]\\nstresses that it is essential to avoid situations
        where researchers are\\nlimited in their choice of publication channels due
        to financial\\ncapacities rather than quality criteria, and where access to
        research\\npublications is restricted by paywalls\\\"\\n\\nZwar sind diese
        Unterstreichung und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner\\nSchritt auf dem
        Weg zur Gestaltung eines pluralistischen, transparenten\\nund nachhaltigen
        Systems der digtialen Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie\\nkommen jedoch zu einem
        Zeitpunkt, zu dem die Kritik an dem Modell der\\nPublikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.\\n\\nErst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den\\nUSA,
        als Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker\\nEinrichtungen, das
        APC-Modell [deutlich\\nkritisiert](https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/).\\nDie
        Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren\\nUngleichheit
        f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut\\nausgestatteten Regionen
        beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt\\nwerden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.\\n\\nAuch hat der \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame\\n[R\xFCcktritt](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5)
        des\\nEditorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender\\nAPCs
        den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die\\nzur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues\\nJournal\\n[gegr\xFCndet](https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/),\\ndas
        niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das\\nProblem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.\\n\\nUm die im obrigen
        Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu\\nadressieren, soll die Koordinierung
        innerhalb der EU und mit globalen\\nPartnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung von Chancengleichheit
        im wissenschaftlichen\\nPublizieren gef\xF6rdert werden (Absatz 7). Hierzu
        sollen auch abgestimmte\\nFinanzierungsstrategien entwickelt werden, um die
        Anzahl von\\nnot-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly publishing
        models in\\nEurope with no costs for authors or readers\\\" signifikant zu
        erh\xF6hen\\n(Absatz 11).\\n\\nAuch soll das Anliegen durch eine m\xF6gliche

        der\\nEU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr Autor:innen

        weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen\\naugegriffen:\_\\n\\n\\\"Some
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into\\ntheir national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly\\npublications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national\\nopen access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications\\nimmediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions\\nacknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like\\nwithin the framework of the European
        Open Science Cloud (EOSC), and\\nsuggest including open science monitoring
        in the European Research Area\\nmonitoring mechanism.\\\"\\n\\nDie Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des\\nwissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer\\nTr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu\\nbegr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote\\nund
        -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder\\ngemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig\\nzu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf\\ninternationaler
        Ebene zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Daf\xFCr sind, wie das\\nPapier richtig
        betont, abgestimmte F\xF6rderaktivit\xE4ten erforderlich, die\\nbeispielsweise

        the British Library has been affected by a significant cyberattack. Many of
        the digital services it provides have gone down and stayed down for many weeks
        now, whilst investigations take place. I have a lot of sympathy for the BL
        staff. As has been <a href=\\\"https://hcommons.social/@mia/111483661298025928\\\">observed</a>,
        public services can be a relatively easy target.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Two of
        the very wide variety of digital services that the BL provide, that I have
        a particular interest in are:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>a) the ISSN National Centre
        for the UK: <a href=\\\"https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html\\\">https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html</a><br>b)
        the E-Theses Online Service (EThOS): <a href=\\\"http://ethos.bl.uk/\\\">http://ethos.bl.uk/</a>
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Both of these services, and many others (do we even know
        how many?) are still offline at the time of writing this (2023-11-30). I can
        probably live without registering a new ISSN, that can wait. But what about
        access to my PhD thesis? I want people to be able to read this. Is it still
        available online anywhere? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>My thesis EThOS ID is: uk.bl.ethos.64202
        . In more normal times it would be publicly available via this link: <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022\\\">https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022</a>
        <br><br>Fortunately, because I retained my rights to it, my thesis is openly-licensed
        under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 licence, and copies of it can be
        uploaded wherever I want. As a consequence, my thesis is also available from
        the <a href=\\\"https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/comparative-cladistics-fossils-morphological-data-partitions-and-\\\">University

        places gives others access to that content in a highly <em>resilient</em>
        way. It is also worth mentioning, there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0165551510389358\\\">study</a>
        suggesting that OA content made available in multiple places gets cited more

        got me thinking again about the major &#8216;Atyponocalypse&#8217; downtime
        event of 17th December 2020. Do you remember it? I certainly do (the screenshot
        above is from that event). The journal hosting platforms of SAGE, ACS Publications,
        Wiley, Taylor &amp; Francis and many others all simultaneously went offline
        for roughly a 24 hour period because of an error at <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon\\\">Atypon</a>,
        the publishing platform that many different legacy publishers use. It was
        unprecedented. People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of important
        knowledge were made almost completely digitally unavailable, worldwide. I
        like how <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185\\\">Brie</a>
        put it, at the time:<br><br>&#8220;One day left for student finals and Wiley&#8217;s
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites are all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and consolidations of academic knowledge again?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click\\\">#WileyDown</a>&#8221;
        (and that was the numbers for just <em>one</em> publisher)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        interesting thing about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for much of
        the content affected, there was no alternative, legal platform hosting the
        content in parallel.  Nor could people put online temporary copies to help
        students and researchers access the content they urgently needed &#8211; because
        of the copyright restrictions on that content. Many of the legacy publishers,
        for their paywalled journals (only), still have this major single-point-of-failure
        weakness.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But open access content does NOT suffer these
        weaknesses.<br><br>As I allude to in the title of this post. The key differentiators
        here in open access systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime
        overall are a) availability on multiple independent platforms and b) open
        licencing that makes it legally easier to host content in multiple places.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tools
        such as Google Scholar, <a href=\\\"https://openalex.org/\\\">OpenAlex</a>,
        and <a href=\\\"https://www.base-search.net/\\\">BASE</a> can signpost the
        way to where these alternative copies live. Research can stay openly accessible
        24/7, 365 days a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed and thus easy
        to host on multiple platforms.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Even if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g. <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/\\\">Michigan</a>
        recently) experience some downtime through cyberattacks or &#8216;unplanned
        maintainence&#8217;, the global collective network of repositories can ensure
        that the scholarship remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different locations.
        \ <strong>The next time you see a paywalled journal experiencing some significant
        downtime, please let me know.</strong> I think there are some very interesting
        natural obervation experiments that could be done around these events to tease
        out the differences in impact between open-licensed and &#8216;all rights
        reserved&#8217; content.  Does anyone maintain a wiki or database of major
        downtime events at academic publishers? There have been quite a few already&#8230;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        you may have seen in the\\n[news](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/22/personal-data-stolen-in-british-library-cyber-attack-appears-for-sale-online),\\nthe
        British Library has been affected by a significant cyberattack. Many\\nof
        the digital services it provides have gone down and stayed down for\\nmany
        weeks now, whilst investigations take place. I have a lot of\\nsympathy for
        the BL staff. As has been\\n[observed](https://hcommons.social/@mia/111483661298025928),
        public\\nservices can be a relatively easy target.\\n\\nTwo of the very wide
        variety of digital services that the BL provide,\\nthat I have a particular
        interest in are:\\n\\na\\\\) the ISSN National Centre for the UK:\\n<https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html>
        \ \\nb) the E-Theses Online Service (EThOS): <http://ethos.bl.uk/>\\n\\nBoth
        of these services, and many others (do we even know how many?) are\\nstill
        offline at the time of writing this (2023-11-30). I can probably\\nlive without
        registering a new ISSN, that can wait. But what about\\naccess to my PhD thesis?
        I want people to be able to read this. Is it\\nstill available online anywhere?\\n\\nMy
        thesis EThOS ID is: uk.bl.ethos.64202 . In more normal times it would\\nbe
        publicly available via this link:\\n<https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022>

        the major 'Atyponocalypse' downtime\\nevent of 17th December 2020. Do you
        remember it? I certainly do (the\\nscreenshot above is from that event). The
        journal hosting platforms of\\nSAGE, ACS Publications, Wiley, Taylor & Francis
        and many others all\\nsimultaneously went offline for roughly a 24 hour period
        because of an\\nerror at [Atypon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon), the
        publishing\\nplatform that many different legacy publishers use. It was\\nunprecedented.
        People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of\\nimportant knowledge
        were made almost completely digitally unavailable,\\nworldwide. I like how\\n[Brie](https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185)
        put\\nit, at the time:  \\n  \\n\\\"One day left for student finals and Wiley's
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites\\nare all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and\\nconsolidations of academic knowledge again?\\\"  \\n  \\n\\\"1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with\\n[\\\\#WileyDown](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click)\\\"\\n(and
        that was the numbers for just *one* publisher)\\n\\nThe interesting thing
        about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for\\nmuch of the content affected,
        there was no alternative, legal platform\\nhosting the content in parallel.
        Nor could people put online temporary\\ncopies to help students and researchers
        access the content they urgently\\nneeded -- because of the copyright restrictions
        on that content. Many of\\nthe legacy publishers, for their paywalled journals
        (only), still have\\nthis major single-point-of-failure weakness.\\n\\nBut
        open access content does NOT suffer these weaknesses.  \\n  \\nAs I allude
        to in the title of this post. The key differentiators here\\nin open access
        systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime\\noverall are a)
        availability on multiple independent platforms and b)\\nopen licencing that
        makes it legally easier to host content in multiple\\nplaces.\\n\\nTools such
        as Google Scholar, [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/), and\\n[BASE](https://www.base-search.net/)
        can signpost the way to where these\\nalternative copies live. Research can
        stay openly accessible 24/7, 365\\ndays a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed
        and thus easy to host\\non multiple platforms.\\n\\nEven if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g.\\n[Michigan](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/)\\nrecently)
        experience some downtime through cyberattacks or 'unplanned\\nmaintainence',
        the global collective network of repositories can ensure\\nthat the scholarship
        remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different\\nlocations. **The next time
        you see a paywalled journal experiencing some\\nsignificant downtime, please
        let me know.** I think there are some very\\ninteresting natural obervation
        experiments that could be done around\\nthese events to tease out the differences
        in impact between\\nopen-licensed and 'all rights reserved' content. Does
        anyone maintain a\\nwiki or database of major downtime events at academic
        publishers? There\\nhave been quite a few already...\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        has been enriched with numerous new indexes of open citation data from different
        sources. However, the quantity and diversification of the ingested information
        have raised several issues, which recently made it essential to conduct a
        complete revision of the ingestion workflow. The result was a revolution in
        the way OpenCitations data is delivered. In this blog post, we will explain
        the context and challenges raised by the old procedure. Then, we will present
        the new ingestion workflow, designed to produce </span><b>just two comprehensive
        collections</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">:</span><b> OpenCitations
        Index</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">, collecting open citation data,
        and </span><b>OpenCitations Meta</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">,
        for the open bibliographical metadata.\_</span></p>\\r\\n<h4 style=\\\"text-align:

        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">In
        2018, OpenCitations released the kickoff version of its first citation index,
        </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/961\\\"><b>COCI </b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">(citations from Crossref)</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">, which contained around 300 million citation links derived from the
        subset of the reference lists in the Crossref database, where citing and cited
        entities were identified using Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). COCI gathered
        citations with associated metadata in compliance with the recommendations
        from the Initiative for Open Citations (</span><a href=\\\"https://i4oc.org/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">I4OC</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">) that citation data should be structured, separable, and open, thus
        marking a turning point by providing a disruptive and free and open alternative
        to earlier sources such as Google Scholar, which provided freely accessible
        data although not downloadable, and Web of Science or Scopus, which demanded
        paid access.\_</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">In a short time, COCI became a competitive
        and trusted index of citation data, used by numerous institutional repositories,
        including </span><a href=\\\"https://service.tib.eu/bison/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight:

        400\\\">Optimeta</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">. In 2021,
        COCI was taken into account </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/1420\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">in a comparative study</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\"> with the most relevant sources in the landscape, including the proprietary
        ones, which showed its coverage approaching parity with those of the other
        sources involved in the analysis (Microsoft Academic, Scopus, Dimensions,
        and Web of Science). At the time of its most recent update in January 2023,
        COCI counted more than 1.4 billion citations. The reason behind this outstanding
        number lies in several factors, including </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/1165\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">Elsevier\u2019s endorsement of the Declaration
        on Research Assessment (DORA) in December 2020</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">, leading to the open release via Crossref of the reference lists
        of the articles published in all its journals, and confirming the value of
        initiatives such as the </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/696\\\"><span

        of heart, in 2019 OpenCitations had tried to narrow the open citations coverage
        gap by launching its second index, the </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/944\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">Crowdsourced Open Citations Index (</span><b>CROCI</b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">)</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">.
        This index allowed publishers and scholars to contribute directly by uploading
        crowdsourced open citations into the OpenCitations infrastructure.</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">In
        December 2022, a new concrete step towards a factual plurality of OpenCitations
        indexes was taken by the ingestion of new data sources into the infrastructure,
        with the publication of the inaugural dumps of </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/3106\\\"><b>DOCI

        of five collections from different sources.\_</span></p>\\r\\n<h4 style=\\\"text-align:

        and new challenges</b></h4>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">While having such a variety and richness of
        indexes helped present the extent of OpenCitations sources, the recent </span><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">increment in the number of sources and the
        diversification of data integrated led to two primary </span><b>issues</b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">: </span></p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n<li style=\\\"list-style-type:
        none\\\">\\r\\n<ol style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\">\\r\\n<li>the necessity

        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">Moreover,
        it soon became evident the need to optimize the reuse of the already developed
        software components </span><b>to facilitate the metadata crosswalk processes
        between the new sources\u2019 data models and the OpenCitations Data Model</b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">, with </span><b>the aim to define a functional
        and easily extendable workflow</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\"> to
        be easily reused when it comes to incorporating new data sources, which should

        enough to capture the necessary information within each of the specific data
        models and formats.\_</span></li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">As
        a solution, we decided to use </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/3140\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">OpenCitations Meta</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">, the new OpenCitations database and tool for managing bibliographic
        data related to the publications involved in the citations. OpenCitations
        Meta makes it possible to assign each entity involved in a citation an internal
        identifier, nominally the OpenCitations Meta Identifier (OMID), to which all
        the associated persistent identifiers of the same publication are redirected.</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">As
        a result, the allocation of an OMID for each bibliographic resource also enabled
        the unambiguous identification of each citation, regardless of the persistent
        identifier schema originally used by the data source to identify the resources.
        This approach allowed us to perform data deduplication and finally make all
        the sources\u2019 contributions converge into </span><b>a unified index containing
        all the unique citations managed by OpenCitations, expressed as OMID to OMID
        citation links.</b></p>\\r\\n<h4 style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><b>The
        revised workflow</b></h4>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">The new workflow is based on </span><b>three
        main components</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\"> with the </span><b>benefit
        </b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">of optimizing the process both in
        terms of computational cost and in terms of flexibility. As shown in Fig.
        1, in a preliminary step, source-specific software converts the input dataset
        &#8211; structured according to the source data model &#8211; to extract two
        OpenCitations Data Model compliant data collections in tabular format for
        bibliographic metadata and citation data, respectively.</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">The
        following steps are common to the process of each dataset.\_\_</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><b>STEP 1</b><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">: The bibliographic metadata collection is used as input for the META
        software. At this stage, it is checked whether or not the bibliographic entities
        have been previously integrated into our infrastructure (coming from other
        data sources). If so, the existing OMID is linked also to the new alternative
        identifiers of the new bibliographic resources. New metadata values, if any,
        are also integrated. A new OMID identifier is produced for entities never
        previously encountered, uniquely representing the bibliographic resource in
        OpenCitations. The outputs of the process are: (I) an updated version of the

        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"

        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve

        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing

        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,

        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,

        across the globe with the megadiverse\\ncontinent of Africa showing a 66%
        reduction in biodiversity, and Latin\\nAmerica and the Caribbean showing a
        staggering 94% reduction in\\nbiodiversity. The message is clear -- we have

        to Florida from the mid-1990s.\\n\\nMuch more technically challenging is the
        use of cloning to increase\\ngenetic fitness in endangered species. Oliver
        was swift to point out\\nthat this approach has been used for the critically
        endangered\\nPrzewalski's horse. The [first cloned *Equus\\nprzewalskii*](https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer

        resources in a fair and equitable way. One of\\nthe key features of the Nagoya
        Protocol agreement is that a permit is\\nrequired for gathering a specimen.
        From a GGBN perspective, it is a\\nrequirement to share this information with

        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access
        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such
        policies. The whole system rests on this logic of extraction and that&#8217;s
        what needs to be opposed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"Today's

        it's easy to criticise open access policies for their harmful impact,\\nbut

        not of wanting to make the literature freely\\navailable to all. Open access
        policies do not address the problem of\\nmarketisation largely because they
        are not designed to do so.\\nProfit-seeking actors create business models
        to maximise their revenues\\nas a result of such policies. The whole system

        processes and supports within an institution can, I&#8217;ve noticed, demand
        a bit of effort to change. When we speak of <strong>open scholarship</strong>
        or <strong>open science</strong>, many aspects tie-in or lead out from those
        concepts, which makes the whole prospect of institutional change quite complex.
        I&#8217;m very excited about the efforts so far that the Open Science Working
        Group (of which I&#8217;m a participant) at Concordia University has undertaken
        and accomplished. These include an initial report on &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.11573/spectrum.library.concordia.ca.00992647\\\"><strong>Recommendations

        course, the Library is always doing outreach about open access (OA). In the
        past I&#8217;ve organized activities, events, and <a href=\\\"https://chroknowlogy.ca/intellectual-liberty/2022/talk-broad-value-open-access/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"post\\\" data-id=\\\"64563\\\">projects</a> for <a href=\\\"https://www.openaccessweek.org/\\\">open
        access week</a>. I can see how frequently our modern research practices, which
        involve digital techniques are enabled by the various forms of open: open
        source, open data, open protocols, open access, etc. However, I&#8217;ve always
        found that it&#8217;s a struggle to get people&#8217;s interest and that we
        have to be creative in order to educate about OA issues. Part of what I suspect
        makes advocating for OA difficult is the sort of singularity that comes from
        being &#8220;just the library,&#8221; the group that&#8217;s always talking
        about it. So when this Open Science Working Group formed, I was excited about
        its multidisciplinary nature and that it included both students and faculty.
        I think that really helps to broaden involvement across the university.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        working group, led by colleagues Krista Byers-Heinlein (who is also Concordia
        University Research Chair in Bilingualism and Open Science) and Nicol\xE1s
        Alessandroni, initiated the effort through a day-long <a href=\\\"https://www.concordia.ca/cuevents/artsci/2022/05/27/open-science-concordia.html\\\">conference
        on open science</a> in 2022. Later they established the working group by inviting
        people to participate in a workshop (there were over 20 people representing
        many disciplines). The workshop operated through a modified form of DORA&#8217;s
        <a href=\\\"https://sfdora.org/resource/workshop-toolkit-to-introduce-the-space-rubric/\\\">SPACE
        rubric</a>, which was designed for academic institutions to use toward improving
        their policies. I think using that tool to organize such a large group of
        people toward a practical outcome was extremely beneficial. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        more meetings, discussions, and revisions the working group was able to produce

        processes and supports within an institution can, I've noticed,\\ndemand a
        bit of effort to change. When we speak of **open scholarship**\\nor **open
        science**, many aspects tie-in or lead out from those\\nconcepts, which makes
        the whole prospect of institutional change quite\\ncomplex. I'm very excited
        about the efforts so far that the Open Science\\nWorking Group (of which I'm
        a participant) at Concordia University has\\nundertaken and accomplished.
        These include an initial report on\\n\\\"[**Recommendations for Fostering
        Open Science at Concordia\\nUniversity**](https://doi.org/10.11573/spectrum.library.concordia.ca.00992647)\\\"\\n(DOI:
        10.11573/spectrum.library.concordia.ca.00992647)\\n\\nOf course, the Library
        is always doing outreach about open access (OA).\\nIn the past I've organized
        activities, events, and\\n[projects](https://chroknowlogy.ca/intellectual-liberty/2022/talk-broad-value-open-access/){data-type=\\\"post\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"64563\\\"}
        for [open access\\nweek](https://www.openaccessweek.org/). I can see how frequently
        our\\nmodern research practices, which involve digital techniques are enabled\\nby
        the various forms of open: open source, open data, open protocols,\\nopen
        access, etc. However, I've always found that it's a struggle to get\\npeople's
        interest and that we have to be creative in order to educate\\nabout OA issues.
        Part of what I suspect makes advocating for OA\\ndifficult is the sort of
        singularity that comes from being \\\"just the\\nlibrary,\\\" the group that's
        always talking about it. So when this Open\\nScience Working Group formed,
        I was excited about its multidisciplinary\\nnature and that it included both
        students and faculty. I think that\\nreally helps to broaden involvement across
        the university.\\n\\nThe working group, led by colleagues Krista Byers-Heinlein
        (who is also\\nConcordia University Research Chair in Bilingualism and Open
        Science)\\nand Nicol\xE1s Alessandroni, initiated the effort through a day-long\\n[conference
        on open\\nscience](https://www.concordia.ca/cuevents/artsci/2022/05/27/open-science-concordia.html)\\nin
        2022. Later they established the working group by inviting people to\\nparticipate
        in a workshop (there were over 20 people representing many\\ndisciplines).
        The workshop operated through a modified form of DORA's\\n[SPACE\\nrubric](https://sfdora.org/resource/workshop-toolkit-to-introduce-the-space-rubric/),\\nwhich
        was designed for academic institutions to use toward improving\\ntheir policies.
        I think using that tool to organize such a large group\\nof people toward
        a practical outcome was extremely beneficial.\\n\\nAfter more meetings, discussions,
        and revisions the working group was\\nable to produce a set of\\n[recommendations](https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/id/eprint/992647/)\\nto
        bolster open scholarship throughout the university. It addresses many\\nissues,
        including existing policies, outreach, inter-institutional work,\\nposition
        principles, open education, resources, and more. Of course,\\nthis is not
        the end of the process. Among other things, next steps\\ninclude focused discussions

        ongoing work.\\n\\nThe recommendations in the report tend to be specific within
        the context\\nof Concordia University but I felt it worthwhile to write about

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im\\nBereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen\\nbetont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und\\nFinanzierungsmodellen, die
        weder die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen\\nfinanziell belasten und sich
        durch angemessene und transparente Preise\\nauszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird
        beklagt, dass die steigenden Preise f\xFCr\\nwissenschaftliche Fachinformationen
        zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren und die\\n\xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil
        der Forschung belasten (Punkt\\n5).\\n\\nAufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen
        Verlagswesen wird in zwei\\nbemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung
        von nicht\\ngewinnorientierten Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:\\n\\n\\\"The
        Council of the European Union \\\\[...\\\\] highlights the importance of\\nnot-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not\\ncharge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their\\nwork without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the\\nvariety of models that do not depend on
        article processing charges or\\nsimilar per-unit charges and stresses the
        importance of supporting the\\ndevelopment of such models led by public research
        organisations; \\\\[...\\\\]\\nstresses that it is essential to avoid situations
        where researchers are\\nlimited in their choice of publication channels due
        to financial\\ncapacities rather than quality criteria, and where access to
        research\\npublications is restricted by paywalls\\\"\\n\\nZwar sind diese
        Unterstreichung und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner\\nSchritt auf dem
        Weg zur Gestaltung eines pluralistischen, transparenten\\nund nachhaltigen
        Systems der digtialen Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie\\nkommen jedoch zu einem
        Zeitpunkt, zu dem die Kritik an dem Modell der\\nPublikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.\\n\\nErst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den\\nUSA,
        als Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker\\nEinrichtungen, das
        APC-Modell [deutlich\\nkritisiert](https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/).\\nDie
        Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren\\nUngleichheit
        f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut\\nausgestatteten Regionen
        beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt\\nwerden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.\\n\\nAuch hat der \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame\\n[R\xFCcktritt](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5)
        des\\nEditorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender\\nAPCs
        den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die\\nzur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues\\nJournal\\n[gegr\xFCndet](https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/),\\ndas
        niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das\\nProblem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.\\n\\nUm die im obrigen
        Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu\\nadressieren, soll die Koordinierung
        innerhalb der EU und mit globalen\\nPartnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung von Chancengleichheit
        im wissenschaftlichen\\nPublizieren gef\xF6rdert werden (Absatz 7). Hierzu
        sollen auch abgestimmte\\nFinanzierungsstrategien entwickelt werden, um die
        Anzahl von\\nnot-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly publishing
        models in\\nEurope with no costs for authors or readers\\\" signifikant zu
        erh\xF6hen\\n(Absatz 11).\\n\\nAuch soll das Anliegen durch eine m\xF6gliche

        weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen\\naugegriffen:\_\\n\\n\\\"Some

        you may have seen in the <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/22/personal-data-stolen-in-british-library-cyber-attack-appears-for-sale-online\\\">news</a>,
        the British Library has been affected by a significant cyberattack. Many of
        the digital services it provides have gone down and stayed down for many weeks
        now, whilst investigations take place. I have a lot of sympathy for the BL
        staff. As has been <a href=\\\"https://hcommons.social/@mia/111483661298025928\\\">observed</a>,
        public services can be a relatively easy target.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Two of
        the very wide variety of digital services that the BL provide, that I have
        a particular interest in are:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>a) the ISSN National Centre
        for the UK: <a href=\\\"https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html\\\">https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html</a><br>b)
        the E-Theses Online Service (EThOS): <a href=\\\"http://ethos.bl.uk/\\\">http://ethos.bl.uk/</a>
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Both of these services, and many others (do we even know
        how many?) are still offline at the time of writing this (2023-11-30). I can
        probably live without registering a new ISSN, that can wait. But what about
        access to my PhD thesis? I want people to be able to read this. Is it still
        available online anywhere? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>My thesis EThOS ID is: uk.bl.ethos.64202
        . In more normal times it would be publicly available via this link: <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022\\\">https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022</a>
        <br><br>Fortunately, because I retained my rights to it, my thesis is openly-licensed
        under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 licence, and copies of it can be
        uploaded wherever I want. As a consequence, my thesis is also available from
        the <a href=\\\"https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/comparative-cladistics-fossils-morphological-data-partitions-and-\\\">University

        Archive</a>. Even if one or two of these repositories goes down, it&#8217;s
        highly likely that my thesis will always be accessible from somewhere on the
        internet 24/7, no matter what. Posting content in multiple independently-run
        places gives others access to that content in a highly <em>resilient</em>
        way. It is also worth mentioning, there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0165551510389358\\\">study</a>
        suggesting that OA content made available in multiple places gets cited more
        than OA content only available in one place.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        got me thinking again about the major &#8216;Atyponocalypse&#8217; downtime
        event of 17th December 2020. Do you remember it? I certainly do (the screenshot
        above is from that event). The journal hosting platforms of SAGE, ACS Publications,
        Wiley, Taylor &amp; Francis and many others all simultaneously went offline
        for roughly a 24 hour period because of an error at <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon\\\">Atypon</a>,
        the publishing platform that many different legacy publishers use. It was
        unprecedented. People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of important
        knowledge were made almost completely digitally unavailable, worldwide. I
        like how <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185\\\">Brie</a>
        put it, at the time:<br><br>&#8220;One day left for student finals and Wiley&#8217;s
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites are all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and consolidations of academic knowledge again?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click\\\">#WileyDown</a>&#8221;
        (and that was the numbers for just <em>one</em> publisher)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        interesting thing about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for much of
        the content affected, there was no alternative, legal platform hosting the
        content in parallel.  Nor could people put online temporary copies to help
        students and researchers access the content they urgently needed &#8211; because
        of the copyright restrictions on that content. Many of the legacy publishers,
        for their paywalled journals (only), still have this major single-point-of-failure
        weakness.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But open access content does NOT suffer these
        weaknesses.<br><br>As I allude to in the title of this post. The key differentiators
        here in open access systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime
        overall are a) availability on multiple independent platforms and b) open
        licencing that makes it legally easier to host content in multiple places.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tools
        such as Google Scholar, <a href=\\\"https://openalex.org/\\\">OpenAlex</a>,
        and <a href=\\\"https://www.base-search.net/\\\">BASE</a> can signpost the
        way to where these alternative copies live. Research can stay openly accessible
        24/7, 365 days a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed and thus easy
        to host on multiple platforms.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Even if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g. <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/\\\">Michigan</a>
        recently) experience some downtime through cyberattacks or &#8216;unplanned
        maintainence&#8217;, the global collective network of repositories can ensure
        that the scholarship remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different locations.
        \ <strong>The next time you see a paywalled journal experiencing some significant
        downtime, please let me know.</strong> I think there are some very interesting
        natural obervation experiments that could be done around these events to tease
        out the differences in impact between open-licensed and &#8216;all rights
        reserved&#8217; content.  Does anyone maintain a wiki or database of major
        downtime events at academic publishers? There have been quite a few already&#8230;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        has been enriched with numerous new indexes of open citation data from different
        sources. However, the quantity and diversification of the ingested information
        have raised several issues, which recently made it essential to conduct a
        complete revision of the ingestion workflow. The result was a revolution in
        the way OpenCitations data is delivered. In this blog post, we will explain
        the context and challenges raised by the old procedure. Then, we will present
        the new ingestion workflow, designed to produce </span><b>just two comprehensive
        collections</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">:</span><b> OpenCitations
        Index</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">, collecting open citation data,
        and </span><b>OpenCitations Meta</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">,
        for the open bibliographical metadata.\_</span></p>\\r\\n<h4 style=\\\"text-align:
        justify\\\"><b>Once upon a time, there were five OpenCitations indexes\u2026</b></h4>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">In
        2018, OpenCitations released the kickoff version of its first citation index,
        </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/961\\\"><b>COCI </b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">(citations from Crossref)</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">, which contained around 300 million citation links derived from the
        subset of the reference lists in the Crossref database, where citing and cited
        entities were identified using Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). COCI gathered
        citations with associated metadata in compliance with the recommendations
        from the Initiative for Open Citations (</span><a href=\\\"https://i4oc.org/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">I4OC</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">) that citation data should be structured, separable, and open, thus
        marking a turning point by providing a disruptive and free and open alternative
        to earlier sources such as Google Scholar, which provided freely accessible
        data although not downloadable, and Web of Science or Scopus, which demanded
        paid access.\_</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">In a short time, COCI became a competitive
        and trusted index of citation data, used by numerous institutional repositories,
        including </span><a href=\\\"https://service.tib.eu/bison/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">B!son</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\"> and </span><a

        400\\\">Optimeta</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">. In 2021,
        COCI was taken into account </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/1420\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">in a comparative study</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\"> with the most relevant sources in the landscape, including the proprietary
        ones, which showed its coverage approaching parity with those of the other
        sources involved in the analysis (Microsoft Academic, Scopus, Dimensions,
        and Web of Science). At the time of its most recent update in January 2023,
        COCI counted more than 1.4 billion citations. The reason behind this outstanding
        number lies in several factors, including </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/1165\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">Elsevier\u2019s endorsement of the Declaration
        on Research Assessment (DORA) in December 2020</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">, leading to the open release via Crossref of the reference lists
        of the articles published in all its journals, and confirming the value of
        initiatives such as the </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/696\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC)</span></a><span

        justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">However, before this change
        of heart, in 2019 OpenCitations had tried to narrow the open citations coverage
        gap by launching its second index, the </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/944\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">Crowdsourced Open Citations Index (</span><b>CROCI</b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">)</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">.
        This index allowed publishers and scholars to contribute directly by uploading
        crowdsourced open citations into the OpenCitations infrastructure.</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">In
        December 2022, a new concrete step towards a factual plurality of OpenCitations
        indexes was taken by the ingestion of new data sources into the infrastructure,
        with the publication of the inaugural dumps of </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/3106\\\"><b>DOCI
        </b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">(citations from DataCite)</span></a><span

        released too, and </span><b>JOCI </b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">(citations

        400\\\">) is expected to be available by the end of November 2023, for a total
        of five collections from different sources.\_</span></p>\\r\\n<h4 style=\\\"text-align:
        justify\\\"><b>Why a new workflow? The issues with multiple sources management
        and new challenges</b></h4>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">While having such a variety and richness of
        indexes helped present the extent of OpenCitations sources, the recent </span><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">increment in the number of sources and the
        diversification of data integrated led to two primary </span><b>issues</b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">: </span></p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n<li style=\\\"list-style-type:
        none\\\">\\r\\n<ol style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\">\\r\\n<li>the necessity
        to handle the ingestion of new identifier types in a DOI-based software infrastructure,
        and</li>\\r\\n<li>the consequent possibility of encountering the same citation
        expressed by several sources with different identifiers.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">Moreover,
        it soon became evident the need to optimize the reuse of the already developed
        software components </span><b>to facilitate the metadata crosswalk processes
        between the new sources\u2019 data models and the OpenCitations Data Model</b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">, with </span><b>the aim to define a functional
        and easily extendable workflow</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\"> to
        be easily reused when it comes to incorporating new data sources, which should
        be:\_</span></p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n<li style=\\\"list-style-type: none\\\">\\r\\n<ol
        style=\\\"list-style-type: lower-alpha;text-align: justify\\\">\\r\\n<li><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">sufficiently generic to establish a globally
        unique procedure;\_</span></li>\\r\\n<li><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">customizable
        enough to capture the necessary information within each of the specific data
        models and formats.\_</span></li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">As
        a solution, we decided to use </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/3140\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">OpenCitations Meta</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">, the new OpenCitations database and tool for managing bibliographic
        data related to the publications involved in the citations. OpenCitations
        Meta makes it possible to assign each entity involved in a citation an internal
        identifier, nominally the OpenCitations Meta Identifier (OMID), to which all
        the associated persistent identifiers of the same publication are redirected.</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">As
        a result, the allocation of an OMID for each bibliographic resource also enabled
        the unambiguous identification of each citation, regardless of the persistent
        identifier schema originally used by the data source to identify the resources.
        This approach allowed us to perform data deduplication and finally make all
        the sources\u2019 contributions converge into </span><b>a unified index containing
        all the unique citations managed by OpenCitations, expressed as OMID to OMID
        citation links.</b></p>\\r\\n<h4 style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><b>The
        revised workflow</b></h4>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">The new workflow is based on </span><b>three
        main components</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\"> with the </span><b>benefit
        </b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">of optimizing the process both in
        terms of computational cost and in terms of flexibility. As shown in Fig.
        1, in a preliminary step, source-specific software converts the input dataset
        &#8211; structured according to the source data model &#8211; to extract two
        OpenCitations Data Model compliant data collections in tabular format for
        bibliographic metadata and citation data, respectively.</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">The
        following steps are common to the process of each dataset.\_\_</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><b>STEP 1</b><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">: The bibliographic metadata collection is used as input for the META
        software. At this stage, it is checked whether or not the bibliographic entities
        have been previously integrated into our infrastructure (coming from other
        data sources). If so, the existing OMID is linked also to the new alternative
        identifiers of the new bibliographic resources. New metadata values, if any,
        are also integrated. A new OMID identifier is produced for entities never
        previously encountered, uniquely representing the bibliographic resource in
        OpenCitations. The outputs of the process are: (I) an updated version of the
        OpenCitations Meta collection that also includes the metadata of the bibliographic
        entities provided by the new source, and (II) a collection of provenance data.
        An internal database is constantly refreshed to preserve correspondence between
        IDs and the associated internal OMIDs.</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:
        justify\\\"><b>STEP 2</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">: Starting from
        the collection of citations expressed as directional links between identifiers
        of potentially any type (e.g., DOI-DOI, PMID-PMID, PMC-PMID, etc.), the INDEX
        software queries the internal database mapping IDs to OMIDs to produce an
        updated version of the OpenCitations Index: unique citations expressed as
        OMID-OMID links in different formats, accompanied by their corresponding provenance
        data.</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\"

        new indexes of open citation data from different sources.\\nHowever, the quantity
        and diversification of the ingested information\\nhave raised several issues,
        which recently made it essential to conduct\\na complete revision of the ingestion

        database and tool for managing bibliographic data\\nrelated to the publications
        involved in the citations. OpenCitations\\nMeta makes it possible to assign
        each entity involved in a citation an\\ninternal identifier, nominally the

        identifiers of the same\\npublication are redirected.]{style=\\\"font-weight:

        As shown in Fig. 1, in a preliminary step,\\nsource-specific software converts
        the input dataset -- structured\\naccording to the source data model -- to
        extract two OpenCitations Data\\nModel compliant data collections in tabular
        format for bibliographic\\nmetadata and citation data, respectively.]{style=\\\"font-weight:

        400\\\"}\\n\\n**STEP 1**[: The bibliographic metadata collection is used as
        input for\\nthe META software. At this stage, it is checked whether or not
        the\\nbibliographic entities have been previously integrated into our\\ninfrastructure
        (coming from other data sources). If so, the existing\\nOMID is linked also
        to the new alternative identifiers of the new\\nbibliographic resources. New
        metadata values, if any, are also\\nintegrated. A new OMID identifier is produced
        for entities never\\npreviously encountered, uniquely representing the bibliographic
        resource\\nin OpenCitations. The outputs of the process are: (I) an updated
        version\\nof the OpenCitations Meta collection that also includes the metadata
        of\\nthe bibliographic entities provided by the new source, and (II) a\\ncollection
        of provenance data. An internal database is constantly\\nrefreshed to preserve
        correspondence between IDs and the associated\\ninternal OMIDs.]{style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\"}\\n\\n**STEP 2**[: Starting from the collection of citations expressed
        as\\ndirectional links between identifiers of potentially any type (e.g.,\\nDOI-DOI,
        PMID-PMID, PMC-PMID, etc.), the INDEX software queries the\\ninternal database
        mapping IDs to OMIDs to produce an updated version of\\nthe OpenCitations
        Index: unique citations expressed as OMID-OMID links\\nin different formats,

        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation

        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the

        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus

        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.
        As Jocelyn explained, \u201Cthe heart of the Nagoya protocol is community

        samples from across the\\nTree of Life, whose mission is to foster collaborations
        among\\nbiodiversity and biobanking repositories in order to ensure quality\\nstandards
        and harmonise exchange of material in accordance with national\\nand international
        legislation and conventions. GigaScience Press Data\\nScientist Chris Armit

        **Confronting the Global Decline in Biodiversity: The GGBN Perspective** {#confronting-the-global-decline-in-biodiversity-the-ggbn-perspective
        .wp-block-heading}\\n\\n**Oliver Ryder** (San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance
        IUCN-SSC Animal\\nBiobanking for Conservation Specialist Group, and [co-founder
        of\\nGenome10K](https://doi.org/10.1186/2047-217X-3-32){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer

        A study of 31,821 populations representing 5,230\\nspecies monitored across
        the globe showed a 69% decline in abundance.\\nThe decline is disproportionate
        across the globe with the megadiverse\\ncontinent of Africa showing a 66%
        reduction in biodiversity, and Latin\\nAmerica and the Caribbean showing a
        staggering 94% reduction in\\nbiodiversity. The message is clear -- we have
        to act now to conserve our\\nliving planet.\\n\\nConservation is a key focus
        of the GGBN, and this network -- coordinated\\nby the GGBN Secretariat hosted
        and supported by the National Museum of\\nNatural History, Smithsonian Institution,
        Washington, DC -- aims to\\nprovide the necessary Data Standards for BioBanked

        Biobanking for\\nConservation.*\\n\\nThe term 'Data Standards' is used to
        describe a set of terms and\\ncontrolled vocabularies designed to represent
        facts about a\\nsample/voucher. An additional important concept pertinent
        to the focus\\nof GGBN is the \\\"Digital Extended Specimen\\\", which is
        a cloud of\\ninformation around a vouchered specimen and which can include
        genomic\\nsequence data and metabolomics data.\\n\\n### **One Plan Approach**
        {#one-plan-approach .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nIn his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder
        highlighted the need for a common\\nstandard of good practice and information
        sharing. Towards this end,\\nOliver showcased the \\\"One Plan Approach\\\"
        which was formulated at the\\nIUCN World Conservation Congress 2020 at its
        session in Marseille,\\nFrance, and which \\\"urges the Secretariat and professional
        societies to\\npromote integration of *in situ* and *ex situ* conservation\\ninterventions\\\"
        and \\\"to ensure effective use of all available\\nconservation tools\\\".\\n\\nOf
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN\\nCommissions and
        Members to \\\"enable and support establishment of a global\\nnetwork of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species\\nconservation targets and
        operating to common standards of good practice\\nand information sharing.\\\"\\n\\n###
        **Genetic Rescue and Cloning** {#genetic-rescue-and-cloning .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nOliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost\\namongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue\\ninvolves an increase
        in fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated\\nindividuals into small,
        declining populations, and we have [explored\\nthis topic\\npreviously](http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"} with our publication of the genome of the\\ncritically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver\\nhighlighted how genetic rescue
        has been successful in [increasing the\\nfitness of the Florida\\npanther](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"} *Puma* *concolor coryi*, by moving female\\npanthers from Texas
        to Florida from the mid-1990s.\\n\\nMuch more technically challenging is the
        use of cloning to increase\\ngenetic fitness in endangered species. Oliver
        was swift to point out\\nthat this approach has been used for the critically
        endangered\\nPrzewalski's horse. The [first cloned *Equus\\nprzewalskii*](https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"} was foaled on August 6th 2020 and was named\\n'Kurt' in honour
        of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke of\\nSan Diego Zoo.\\n\\nIn
        the same year, a black-footed ferret named 'Elizabeth Ann' (born\\nDecember
        10, 2020) was [the first U.S. endangered species to be\\ncloned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer

        .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nA core focus of the GGBN conference was cryobanking
        of viable cells and\\ngametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking, **Jackie\\nMackenzie-Dodds**
        (Natural History Museum, London) referred to the\\ncryopreservation facilities
        as a \\\"treasure trove of molecules\\\". Jackie\\npointed out that viable
        cell lines are the most requested resource for\\nthe Natural History Museum
        BioBank, where they are used for the\\ngeneration of induced pluripotent stem
        cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.\\n\\nAnother important message from the GGBN
        conference was the need for Open\\nAccess BioBank facilities. Towards this
        end, an additional incentive for\\nresearchers and curators was provided by
        **Mudzuli Mavhunga** of\\nBiodiversity Biobanks South Africa (South African
        National Biodiversity\\nInstitute, Pretoria). Mudzuli highlighted that, if
        a South African\\nBioBank is awarded the status of Open Access, then it is
        eligible for\\nresource allocations through Biodiversity Biobanks South Africa
        (BBSA),\\nwhich is a great asset for a collection facility.\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        **Scalability of Cloning** {#scalability-of-cloning .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nSo
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? **Ben\\nNovak**
        of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk\\nentitled \\\"Important
        Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of\\nEndangered Species\\\",
        highlighted the example of passerines (perching\\nbirds) where programmed
        DNA loss is observed in some species. In\\npasserines such as the zebra finch
        (*Taeniopygia guttata*), there is a\\n[germ-line-restricted\\nchromosome](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer

        is represented exclusively in the germ cells, and is\\nabsent from somatic

        **Cryopreservation for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues** {#cryopreservation-for-biobanking-of-gametes-and-reproductive-tissues
        .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nOn the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive

        rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been on\\nfield
        trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An\\nimportant

        resources in a fair and equitable way. One of\\nthe key features of the Nagoya
        Protocol agreement is that a permit is\\nrequired for gathering a specimen.
        From a GGBN perspective, it is a\\nrequirement to share this information with
        GGBN, where it is stored in\\nthe Darwin Core metadata associated with a sample.\\n\\nAs
        an illustrative example, **Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago** (Universidad\\nAut\xF3noma
        de Aguascalientes) focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates\\nto Mexico
        and explained, \\\"you need to get a permit of collect\\\". One of\\nthe reasons
        for a permit is to ensure the recognition of the collective\\nproperty of
        indigenous lands, and to ensure that allegations of\\nbiopiracy are excluded
        from genomic collections. As Jocelyn explained,\\n\\\"the heart of the Nagoya
        protocol is community consent -- informed\\nconsent from indigenous people\\\".\\n\\n<figure

        makes the consolidation even more extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers
        went from 47% of the market in 2000 to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest

        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access
        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such
        policies. The whole system rests on this logic of extraction and that&#8217;s
        what needs to be opposed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"Today's

        found that it&#8217;s a struggle to get people&#8217;s interest and that we
        have to be creative in order to educate about OA issues. Part of what I suspect
        makes advocating for OA difficult is the sort of singularity that comes from
        being &#8220;just the library,&#8221; the group that&#8217;s always talking

        people to participate in a workshop (there were over 20 people representing
        many disciplines). The workshop operated through a modified form of DORA&#8217;s

        aktuellen Herausforderungen des wissenschaftlichen\\nPublikationswesens befasst.\\n\\nBereits
        im Vorfeld der Sitzung der Wissenschaftsministerien wurden\\nverschiedene
        Versionen der Erkl\xE4rung \xF6ffentlich diskutiert (siehe z.B.\\n[Science\\nBusiness](https://sciencebusiness.net/news/Universities/leaked-eu-member-states-set-out-reform-scientific-publishing)\\nund
        [Times Higher\\nEducation](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/can-eu-make-parallel-publishing-system-work)).\\nIm
        Kern stand die Frage, inwiefern das EU-Papier den Fokus auf\\nFinanzierungs-
        und Gesch\xE4ftsmodelle abseits von Publikationsgeb\xFChren\\n(Article Processing
        Charges, APCs) legt und ob sogar eine Abkehr von der\\nUnterst\xFCtzung dieses
        Modells durch die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa betont\\nwird.\\n\\nSchweden
        hatte das Thema im Rahmen seiner EU-Ratspr\xE4sidentschaft\\naugegriffen und
        bereits im\\n[Februar](https://wisspub.net/2023/02/10/eu-wissenschaftsministerien-erortern-open-science/)\\nin
        einem Hintergrund-Papier adressiert. Schon in diesem Briefing Paper\\nwurde
        die Problematik steigender Preise f\xFCr die wissenschaftlichen\\nFachinformation
        betont.\_\\n\\nIn der jetzt verabschiedeten Version der Schlussfolgerungen
        die\\nForderung nach sofortigem Open Access f\xFCr wissenschaftliche\\nPublikationen,
        die im Rahmen der \xF6ffentlich gef\xF6rderten Forschung\\nentstehen, nochmals
        betont. Dieses Ziel wurde [bereits\\n2016](https://wisspub.net/2016/05/27/eu-und-g7-staaten-setzen-auf-open-science/)\\nvon
        den EU-Wissenschaftsministerien erhoben. Die\\nWissenschaftsminister:innen
        hatten damals einen Open-Access-Anteil von\\n100 % bis 2020 gefordert. Dieser
        Wert wurde bisher jedoch nicht\\nerreicht. In Deutschland liegt der Open-Access-Anteil
        zum Beispiel bei\\n[63](https://open-access-monitor.de/) Prozent, w\xE4hrend

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im\\nBereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen\\nbetont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und\\nFinanzierungsmodellen, die
        weder die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen\\nfinanziell belasten und sich
        durch angemessene und transparente Preise\\nauszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird
        beklagt, dass die steigenden Preise f\xFCr\\nwissenschaftliche Fachinformationen
        zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren und die\\n\xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil
        der Forschung belasten (Punkt\\n5).\\n\\nAufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen
        Verlagswesen wird in zwei\\nbemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung
        von nicht\\ngewinnorientierten Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:\\n\\n\\\"The
        Council of the European Union \\\\[...\\\\] highlights the importance of\\nnot-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not\\ncharge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their\\nwork without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the\\nvariety of models that do not depend on
        article processing charges or\\nsimilar per-unit charges and stresses the
        importance of supporting the\\ndevelopment of such models led by public research
        organisations; \\\\[...\\\\]\\nstresses that it is essential to avoid situations
        where researchers are\\nlimited in their choice of publication channels due
        to financial\\ncapacities rather than quality criteria, and where access to
        research\\npublications is restricted by paywalls\\\"\\n\\nZwar sind diese
        Unterstreichung und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner\\nSchritt auf dem
        Weg zur Gestaltung eines pluralistischen, transparenten\\nund nachhaltigen
        Systems der digtialen Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie\\nkommen jedoch zu einem
        Zeitpunkt, zu dem die Kritik an dem Modell der\\nPublikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.\\n\\nErst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den\\nUSA,
        als Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker\\nEinrichtungen, das
        APC-Modell [deutlich\\nkritisiert](https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/).\\nDie
        Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren\\nUngleichheit
        f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut\\nausgestatteten Regionen
        beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt\\nwerden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.\\n\\nAuch hat der \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame\\n[R\xFCcktritt](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5)
        des\\nEditorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender\\nAPCs
        den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die\\nzur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues\\nJournal\\n[gegr\xFCndet](https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/),\\ndas
        niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das\\nProblem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.\\n\\nUm die im obrigen
        Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu\\nadressieren, soll die Koordinierung
        innerhalb der EU und mit globalen\\nPartnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung von Chancengleichheit
        im wissenschaftlichen\\nPublizieren gef\xF6rdert werden (Absatz 7). Hierzu
        sollen auch abgestimmte\\nFinanzierungsstrategien entwickelt werden, um die
        Anzahl von\\nnot-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly publishing
        models in\\nEurope with no costs for authors or readers\\\" signifikant zu
        erh\xF6hen\\n(Absatz 11).\\n\\nAuch soll das Anliegen durch eine m\xF6gliche
        Beteiligung der\\nEU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe (ORE), der von
        der\\nEU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr Autor:innen
        aus den\\nEU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).\_\\n\\nIn
        der\\n[Pressemitteilung](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/)\\nwerden
        weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen\\naugegriffen:\_\\n\\n\\\"Some
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into\\ntheir national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly\\npublications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national\\nopen access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications\\nimmediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions\\nacknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like\\nwithin the framework of the European
        Open Science Cloud (EOSC), and\\nsuggest including open science monitoring
        in the European Research Area\\nmonitoring mechanism.\\\"\\n\\nDie Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des\\nwissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer\\nTr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu\\nbegr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote\\nund
        -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder\\ngemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig\\nzu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf\\ninternationaler
        Ebene zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Daf\xFCr sind, wie das\\nPapier richtig
        betont, abgestimmte F\xF6rderaktivit\xE4ten erforderlich, die\\nbeispielsweise
        in Deutschland, komplement\xE4r zu DEAL, dem\\nwissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizieren

        the British Library has been affected by a significant cyberattack. Many of
        the digital services it provides have gone down and stayed down for many weeks
        now, whilst investigations take place. I have a lot of sympathy for the BL
        staff. As has been <a href=\\\"https://hcommons.social/@mia/111483661298025928\\\">observed</a>,
        public services can be a relatively easy target.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Two of
        the very wide variety of digital services that the BL provide, that I have
        a particular interest in are:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>a) the ISSN National Centre
        for the UK: <a href=\\\"https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html\\\">https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html</a><br>b)
        the E-Theses Online Service (EThOS): <a href=\\\"http://ethos.bl.uk/\\\">http://ethos.bl.uk/</a>
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Both of these services, and many others (do we even know
        how many?) are still offline at the time of writing this (2023-11-30). I can
        probably live without registering a new ISSN, that can wait. But what about
        access to my PhD thesis? I want people to be able to read this. Is it still
        available online anywhere? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>My thesis EThOS ID is: uk.bl.ethos.64202
        . In more normal times it would be publicly available via this link: <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022\\\">https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022</a>
        <br><br>Fortunately, because I retained my rights to it, my thesis is openly-licensed
        under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 licence, and copies of it can be
        uploaded wherever I want. As a consequence, my thesis is also available from

        got me thinking again about the major &#8216;Atyponocalypse&#8217; downtime
        event of 17th December 2020. Do you remember it? I certainly do (the screenshot
        above is from that event). The journal hosting platforms of SAGE, ACS Publications,
        Wiley, Taylor &amp; Francis and many others all simultaneously went offline
        for roughly a 24 hour period because of an error at <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon\\\">Atypon</a>,
        the publishing platform that many different legacy publishers use. It was
        unprecedented. People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of important
        knowledge were made almost completely digitally unavailable, worldwide. I
        like how <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185\\\">Brie</a>
        put it, at the time:<br><br>&#8220;One day left for student finals and Wiley&#8217;s
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites are all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and consolidations of academic knowledge again?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click\\\">#WileyDown</a>&#8221;
        (and that was the numbers for just <em>one</em> publisher)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        interesting thing about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for much of
        the content affected, there was no alternative, legal platform hosting the
        content in parallel.  Nor could people put online temporary copies to help
        students and researchers access the content they urgently needed &#8211; because
        of the copyright restrictions on that content. Many of the legacy publishers,

        British Library has been affected by a significant cyberattack. Many\\nof

        of these services, and many others (do we even know how many?) are\\nstill
        offline at the time of writing this (2023-11-30). I can probably\\nlive without
        registering a new ISSN, that can wait. But what about\\naccess to my PhD thesis?
        I want people to be able to read this. Is it\\nstill available online anywhere?\\n\\nMy
        thesis EThOS ID is: uk.bl.ethos.64202 . In more normal times it would\\nbe

        the major 'Atyponocalypse' downtime\\nevent of 17th December 2020. Do you
        remember it? I certainly do (the\\nscreenshot above is from that event). The
        journal hosting platforms of\\nSAGE, ACS Publications, Wiley, Taylor & Francis
        and many others all\\nsimultaneously went offline for roughly a 24 hour period
        because of an\\nerror at [Atypon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon), the
        publishing\\nplatform that many different legacy publishers use. It was\\nunprecedented.
        People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of\\nimportant knowledge
        were made almost completely digitally unavailable,\\nworldwide. I like how\\n[Brie](https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185)
        put\\nit, at the time:  \\n  \\n\\\"One day left for student finals and Wiley's
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites\\nare all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and\\nconsolidations of academic knowledge again?\\\"  \\n  \\n\\\"1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with\\n[\\\\#WileyDown](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click)\\\"\\n(and
        that was the numbers for just *one* publisher)\\n\\nThe interesting thing
        about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for\\nmuch of the content affected,
        there was no alternative, legal platform\\nhosting the content in parallel.
        Nor could people put online temporary\\ncopies to help students and researchers
        access the content they urgently\\nneeded -- because of the copyright restrictions
        on that content. Many of\\nthe legacy publishers, for their paywalled journals
        (only), still have\\nthis major single-point-of-failure weakness.\\n\\nBut
        open access content does NOT suffer these weaknesses.  \\n  \\nAs I allude
        to in the title of this post. The key differentiators here\\nin open access
        systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime\\noverall are a)
        availability on multiple independent platforms and b)\\nopen licencing that

        has been enriched with numerous new indexes of open citation data from different
        sources. However, the quantity and diversification of the ingested information
        have raised several issues, which recently made it essential to conduct a
        complete revision of the ingestion workflow. The result was a revolution in
        the way OpenCitations data is delivered. In this blog post, we will explain
        the context and challenges raised by the old procedure. Then, we will present
        the new ingestion workflow, designed to produce </span><b>just two comprehensive
        collections</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">:</span><b> OpenCitations
        Index</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">, collecting open citation data,
        and </span><b>OpenCitations Meta</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">,
        for the open bibliographical metadata.\_</span></p>\\r\\n<h4 style=\\\"text-align:

        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">In
        2018, OpenCitations released the kickoff version of its first citation index,
        </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/961\\\"><b>COCI </b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">(citations from Crossref)</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">, which contained around 300 million citation links derived from the
        subset of the reference lists in the Crossref database, where citing and cited
        entities were identified using Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). COCI gathered
        citations with associated metadata in compliance with the recommendations
        from the Initiative for Open Citations (</span><a href=\\\"https://i4oc.org/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">I4OC</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">) that citation data should be structured, separable, and open, thus
        marking a turning point by providing a disruptive and free and open alternative
        to earlier sources such as Google Scholar, which provided freely accessible
        data although not downloadable, and Web of Science or Scopus, which demanded
        paid access.\_</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">In a short time, COCI became a competitive
        and trusted index of citation data, used by numerous institutional repositories,
        including </span><a href=\\\"https://service.tib.eu/bison/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight:

        400\\\">Optimeta</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">. In 2021,
        COCI was taken into account </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/1420\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">in a comparative study</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\"> with the most relevant sources in the landscape, including the proprietary
        ones, which showed its coverage approaching parity with those of the other
        sources involved in the analysis (Microsoft Academic, Scopus, Dimensions,
        and Web of Science). At the time of its most recent update in January 2023,
        COCI counted more than 1.4 billion citations. The reason behind this outstanding
        number lies in several factors, including </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/1165\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">Elsevier\u2019s endorsement of the Declaration
        on Research Assessment (DORA) in December 2020</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">, leading to the open release via Crossref of the reference lists
        of the articles published in all its journals, and confirming the value of
        initiatives such as the </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/696\\\"><span

        of heart, in 2019 OpenCitations had tried to narrow the open citations coverage
        gap by launching its second index, the </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/944\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">Crowdsourced Open Citations Index (</span><b>CROCI</b><span

        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">In
        December 2022, a new concrete step towards a factual plurality of OpenCitations
        indexes was taken by the ingestion of new data sources into the infrastructure,
        with the publication of the inaugural dumps of </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/3106\\\"><b>DOCI

        data related to the publications involved in the citations. OpenCitations
        Meta makes it possible to assign each entity involved in a citation an internal
        identifier, nominally the OpenCitations Meta Identifier (OMID), to which all
        the associated persistent identifiers of the same publication are redirected.</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">As
        a result, the allocation of an OMID for each bibliographic resource also enabled
        the unambiguous identification of each citation, regardless of the persistent
        identifier schema originally used by the data source to identify the resources.
        This approach allowed us to perform data deduplication and finally make all

        terms of computational cost and in terms of flexibility. As shown in Fig.
        1, in a preliminary step, source-specific software converts the input dataset
        &#8211; structured according to the source data model &#8211; to extract two
        OpenCitations Data Model compliant data collections in tabular format for

        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><b>STEP 1</b><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">: The bibliographic metadata collection is used as input for the META
        software. At this stage, it is checked whether or not the bibliographic entities
        have been previously integrated into our infrastructure (coming from other
        data sources). If so, the existing OMID is linked also to the new alternative
        identifiers of the new bibliographic resources. New metadata values, if any,
        are also integrated. A new OMID identifier is produced for entities never
        previously encountered, uniquely representing the bibliographic resource in
        OpenCitations. The outputs of the process are: (I) an updated version of the
        OpenCitations Meta collection that also includes the metadata of the bibliographic
        entities provided by the new source, and (II) a collection of provenance data.
        An internal database is constantly refreshed to preserve correspondence between
        IDs and the associated internal OMIDs.</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:

        the collection of citations expressed as directional links between identifiers
        of potentially any type (e.g., DOI-DOI, PMID-PMID, PMC-PMID, etc.), the INDEX
        software queries the internal database mapping IDs to OMIDs to produce an
        updated version of the OpenCitations Index: unique citations expressed as
        OMID-OMID links in different formats, accompanied by their corresponding provenance

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus

        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.

        session in Marseille,\\nFrance, and which \\\"urges the Secretariat and professional
        societies to\\npromote integration of *in situ* and *ex situ* conservation\\ninterventions\\\"
        and \\\"to ensure effective use of all available\\nconservation tools\\\".\\n\\nOf
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN\\nCommissions and
        Members to \\\"enable and support establishment of a global\\nnetwork of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species\\nconservation targets and
        operating to common standards of good practice\\nand information sharing.\\\"\\n\\n###
        **Genetic Rescue and Cloning** {#genetic-rescue-and-cloning .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nOliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost\\namongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue\\ninvolves an increase
        in fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated\\nindividuals into small,
        declining populations, and we have [explored\\nthis topic\\npreviously](http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer

        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver\\nhighlighted how genetic rescue
        has been successful in [increasing the\\nfitness of the Florida\\npanther](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer

        to Florida from the mid-1990s.\\n\\nMuch more technically challenging is the
        use of cloning to increase\\ngenetic fitness in endangered species. Oliver
        was swift to point out\\nthat this approach has been used for the critically
        endangered\\nPrzewalski's horse. The [first cloned *Equus\\nprzewalskii*](https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer

        Protocol agreement is that a permit is\\nrequired for gathering a specimen.

        makes the consolidation even more extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers
        went from 47% of the market in 2000 to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest
        publishers from 54% to controlling 83% of the corpus.</p>\\n<cite>https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/10/30/quantifying-consolidation-in-the-scholarly-journals-market/</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s
        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access
        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such
        policies. The whole system rests on this logic of extraction and that&#8217;s
        what needs to be opposed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"Today's

        publishers from 54% to controlling 83% of the corpus.\\n>\\n> https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/10/30/quantifying-consolidation-in-the-scholarly-journals-market/\\n\\nIt's
        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small\\nnumber of
        academic publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation\\nfrom the year
        2000 onwards, from the concentration brought about by the\\neffects of the
        Big Deal to the present day where 5 publishers now\\ncontrol 61% of the article
        output, brought about by the dominant\\nbusiness models for open access based
        on greater volume and\\ntechnological scale. The author's finger is pointed
        at Coalition S for\\ninstigating a 'rapid state of change' that allows author-pays
        open\\naccess to flourish.\\n\\nI'm no fan of open access policies, Plan S
        especially, and I'm sure that\\npolicy interventions play a part in the consolidation
        at play. There are\\nof course many ways of achieving open access without
        recourse to author\\nfees, transformative agreements, or technologies that
        remove human\\nexpertise in place of automation and scale. But while there
        is nothing\\nnatural or necessary about the relationship between open access
        and\\nconsolidation, there is a much stronger connection between\\ncommercialisation
        and consolidation. The recent history of academic\\npublishing has been of
        marketisation and, hence, consolidation.\\n\\nI always bristle when I read
        that open access is to blame for the\\nproblems with the publishing market,
        not simply because open access does\\nnot have to be a market-based activity
        (and is better when it isn't) but\\nmore because the explanation is so shallow.
        It is a position that\\nusually takes as its starting point that the natural
        and proper way for\\nacademic publishing to be organised is as a commercial
        activity and any\\nintervention that works against this is to blame for the
        deleterious\\neffects of commercialisation. Publishing is and always is a
        business\\n(possibly a reflection of the constituents that the *Scholarly
        Kitchen*\\nrepresents), despite the fact that it is exactly the commercial
        nature\\nof publishing that is the problem.\\n\\nYet open access is good precisely
        because it allows us to reorient\\nacademic publishing away from commercial
        practice and to experiment with\\nforms of publishing that are less reliant
        on competition, profiteering\\nand the extraction of free and under-remunerated
        labour. Policymakers\\nare starting to wake up to this fact, as in part illustrated
        by the turn\\ntowards no-fee and non-commercial forms of open access, and
        I am\\ncautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger is that policymakers\\nmandate
        no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements of\\ncommercial publishing
        and the need to devalue skilled labour in the\\npursuit of revenue.\\n\\nSo
        it's easy to criticise open access policies for their harmful impact,\\nbut
        this has to be done from a position that understands how the same\\nissues
        of profiteering and extraction were a consequence of the\\nsubscription market
        too. They are the logical extension of publishing as\\na market-based activity,
        not of wanting to make the literature freely\\navailable to all. Open access
        policies do not address the problem of\\nmarketisation largely because they
        are not designed to do so.\\nProfit-seeking actors create business models
        to maximise their revenues\\nas a result of such policies. The whole system
        rests on this logic of\\nextraction and that's what needs to be opposed.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/z8017-00204\",\"guid\":\"https://www.samuelmoore.org/?p=1437\",\"id\":\"95fef4ed-6274-47ed-a682-494ef1cb85ef\",\"image\":\"https://www.samuelmoore.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/R229.aa364024.jpg\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1698678686,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"Today\u2019s\\n<em>\\n

        and accomplished. These include an initial report on &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.11573/spectrum.library.concordia.ca.00992647\\\"><strong>Recommendations

        involve digital techniques are enabled by the various forms of open: open
        source, open data, open protocols, open access, etc. However, I&#8217;ve always
        found that it&#8217;s a struggle to get people&#8217;s interest and that we
        have to be creative in order to educate about OA issues. Part of what I suspect
        makes advocating for OA difficult is the sort of singularity that comes from
        being &#8220;just the library,&#8221; the group that&#8217;s always talking
        about it. So when this Open Science Working Group formed, I was excited about
        its multidisciplinary nature and that it included both students and faculty.

        on open science</a> in 2022. Later they established the working group by inviting
        people to participate in a workshop (there were over 20 people representing
        many disciplines). The workshop operated through a modified form of DORA&#8217;s
        <a href=\\\"https://sfdora.org/resource/workshop-toolkit-to-introduce-the-space-rubric/\\\">SPACE
        rubric</a>, which was designed for academic institutions to use toward improving
        their policies. I think using that tool to organize such a large group of
        people toward a practical outcome was extremely beneficial. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        more meetings, discussions, and revisions the working group was able to produce
        a set of <a href=\\\"https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/id/eprint/992647/\\\">recommendations</a>
        to bolster open scholarship throughout the university. It addresses many issues,
        including existing policies, outreach, inter-institutional work, position
        principles, open education, resources, and more. Of course, this is not the
        end of the process. Among other things, next steps include focused discussions
        with department heads, administrators, and others. I imagine that getting
        to a place where open scholarship/open science is well-understood and hopefully
        a default institutional position for research and education will require ongoing

        [Times Higher\\nEducation](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/can-eu-make-parallel-publishing-system-work)).\\nIm

        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und\\nFinanzierungsmodellen, die
        weder die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen\\nfinanziell belasten und sich
        durch angemessene und transparente Preise\\nauszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird
        beklagt, dass die steigenden Preise f\xFCr\\nwissenschaftliche Fachinformationen
        zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren und die\\n\xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil
        der Forschung belasten (Punkt\\n5).\\n\\nAufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen
        Verlagswesen wird in zwei\\nbemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung
        von nicht\\ngewinnorientierten Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:\\n\\n\\\"The
        Council of the European Union \\\\[...\\\\] highlights the importance of\\nnot-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not\\ncharge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their\\nwork without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the\\nvariety of models that do not depend on
        article processing charges or\\nsimilar per-unit charges and stresses the
        importance of supporting the\\ndevelopment of such models led by public research
        organisations; \\\\[...\\\\]\\nstresses that it is essential to avoid situations
        where researchers are\\nlimited in their choice of publication channels due
        to financial\\ncapacities rather than quality criteria, and where access to
        research\\npublications is restricted by paywalls\\\"\\n\\nZwar sind diese
        Unterstreichung und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner\\nSchritt auf dem
        Weg zur Gestaltung eines pluralistischen, transparenten\\nund nachhaltigen
        Systems der digtialen Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie\\nkommen jedoch zu einem
        Zeitpunkt, zu dem die Kritik an dem Modell der\\nPublikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.\\n\\nErst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den\\nUSA,
        als Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker\\nEinrichtungen, das
        APC-Modell [deutlich\\nkritisiert](https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/).\\nDie

        f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut\\nausgestatteten Regionen

        you may have seen in the <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/22/personal-data-stolen-in-british-library-cyber-attack-appears-for-sale-online\\\">news</a>,
        the British Library has been affected by a significant cyberattack. Many of
        the digital services it provides have gone down and stayed down for many weeks
        now, whilst investigations take place. I have a lot of sympathy for the BL
        staff. As has been <a href=\\\"https://hcommons.social/@mia/111483661298025928\\\">observed</a>,
        public services can be a relatively easy target.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Two of
        the very wide variety of digital services that the BL provide, that I have
        a particular interest in are:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>a) the ISSN National Centre
        for the UK: <a href=\\\"https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html\\\">https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html</a><br>b)
        the E-Theses Online Service (EThOS): <a href=\\\"http://ethos.bl.uk/\\\">http://ethos.bl.uk/</a>
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Both of these services, and many others (do we even know
        how many?) are still offline at the time of writing this (2023-11-30). I can
        probably live without registering a new ISSN, that can wait. But what about
        access to my PhD thesis? I want people to be able to read this. Is it still
        available online anywhere? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>My thesis EThOS ID is: uk.bl.ethos.64202
        . In more normal times it would be publicly available via this link: <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022\\\">https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022</a>
        <br><br>Fortunately, because I retained my rights to it, my thesis is openly-licensed
        under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 licence, and copies of it can be
        uploaded wherever I want. As a consequence, my thesis is also available from
        the <a href=\\\"https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/comparative-cladistics-fossils-morphological-data-partitions-and-\\\">University

        highly likely that my thesis will always be accessible from somewhere on the
        internet 24/7, no matter what. Posting content in multiple independently-run
        places gives others access to that content in a highly <em>resilient</em>
        way. It is also worth mentioning, there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0165551510389358\\\">study</a>
        suggesting that OA content made available in multiple places gets cited more

        got me thinking again about the major &#8216;Atyponocalypse&#8217; downtime
        event of 17th December 2020. Do you remember it? I certainly do (the screenshot
        above is from that event). The journal hosting platforms of SAGE, ACS Publications,
        Wiley, Taylor &amp; Francis and many others all simultaneously went offline
        for roughly a 24 hour period because of an error at <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon\\\">Atypon</a>,
        the publishing platform that many different legacy publishers use. It was
        unprecedented. People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of important
        knowledge were made almost completely digitally unavailable, worldwide. I
        like how <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185\\\">Brie</a>
        put it, at the time:<br><br>&#8220;One day left for student finals and Wiley&#8217;s
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites are all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and consolidations of academic knowledge again?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click\\\">#WileyDown</a>&#8221;
        (and that was the numbers for just <em>one</em> publisher)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        interesting thing about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for much of
        the content affected, there was no alternative, legal platform hosting the
        content in parallel.  Nor could people put online temporary copies to help
        students and researchers access the content they urgently needed &#8211; because
        of the copyright restrictions on that content. Many of the legacy publishers,
        for their paywalled journals (only), still have this major single-point-of-failure
        weakness.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But open access content does NOT suffer these
        weaknesses.<br><br>As I allude to in the title of this post. The key differentiators
        here in open access systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime
        overall are a) availability on multiple independent platforms and b) open
        licencing that makes it legally easier to host content in multiple places.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tools
        such as Google Scholar, <a href=\\\"https://openalex.org/\\\">OpenAlex</a>,
        and <a href=\\\"https://www.base-search.net/\\\">BASE</a> can signpost the
        way to where these alternative copies live. Research can stay openly accessible
        24/7, 365 days a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed and thus easy
        to host on multiple platforms.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Even if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g. <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/\\\">Michigan</a>
        recently) experience some downtime through cyberattacks or &#8216;unplanned
        maintainence&#8217;, the global collective network of repositories can ensure
        that the scholarship remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different locations.
        \ <strong>The next time you see a paywalled journal experiencing some significant
        downtime, please let me know.</strong> I think there are some very interesting
        natural obervation experiments that could be done around these events to tease
        out the differences in impact between open-licensed and &#8216;all rights
        reserved&#8217; content.  Does anyone maintain a wiki or database of major
        downtime events at academic publishers? There have been quite a few already&#8230;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        has been enriched with numerous new indexes of open citation data from different
        sources. However, the quantity and diversification of the ingested information
        have raised several issues, which recently made it essential to conduct a
        complete revision of the ingestion workflow. The result was a revolution in
        the way OpenCitations data is delivered. In this blog post, we will explain
        the context and challenges raised by the old procedure. Then, we will present
        the new ingestion workflow, designed to produce </span><b>just two comprehensive
        collections</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">:</span><b> OpenCitations
        Index</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">, collecting open citation data,
        and </span><b>OpenCitations Meta</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">,
        for the open bibliographical metadata.\_</span></p>\\r\\n<h4 style=\\\"text-align:
        justify\\\"><b>Once upon a time, there were five OpenCitations indexes\u2026</b></h4>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">In
        2018, OpenCitations released the kickoff version of its first citation index,
        </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/961\\\"><b>COCI </b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">(citations from Crossref)</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">, which contained around 300 million citation links derived from the
        subset of the reference lists in the Crossref database, where citing and cited
        entities were identified using Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). COCI gathered
        citations with associated metadata in compliance with the recommendations
        from the Initiative for Open Citations (</span><a href=\\\"https://i4oc.org/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">I4OC</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">) that citation data should be structured, separable, and open, thus
        marking a turning point by providing a disruptive and free and open alternative
        to earlier sources such as Google Scholar, which provided freely accessible
        data although not downloadable, and Web of Science or Scopus, which demanded
        paid access.\_</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">In a short time, COCI became a competitive
        and trusted index of citation data, used by numerous institutional repositories,
        including </span><a href=\\\"https://service.tib.eu/bison/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">B!son</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\"> and </span><a

        400\\\">Optimeta</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">. In 2021,
        COCI was taken into account </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/1420\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">in a comparative study</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\"> with the most relevant sources in the landscape, including the proprietary
        ones, which showed its coverage approaching parity with those of the other
        sources involved in the analysis (Microsoft Academic, Scopus, Dimensions,
        and Web of Science). At the time of its most recent update in January 2023,
        COCI counted more than 1.4 billion citations. The reason behind this outstanding
        number lies in several factors, including </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/1165\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">Elsevier\u2019s endorsement of the Declaration
        on Research Assessment (DORA) in December 2020</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">, leading to the open release via Crossref of the reference lists
        of the articles published in all its journals, and confirming the value of
        initiatives such as the </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/696\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC)</span></a><span

        justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">However, before this change
        of heart, in 2019 OpenCitations had tried to narrow the open citations coverage
        gap by launching its second index, the </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/944\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">Crowdsourced Open Citations Index (</span><b>CROCI</b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">)</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">.
        This index allowed publishers and scholars to contribute directly by uploading
        crowdsourced open citations into the OpenCitations infrastructure.</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">In
        December 2022, a new concrete step towards a factual plurality of OpenCitations
        indexes was taken by the ingestion of new data sources into the infrastructure,
        with the publication of the inaugural dumps of </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/3106\\\"><b>DOCI

        of five collections from different sources.\_</span></p>\\r\\n<h4 style=\\\"text-align:
        justify\\\"><b>Why a new workflow? The issues with multiple sources management
        and new challenges</b></h4>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">While having such a variety and richness of
        indexes helped present the extent of OpenCitations sources, the recent </span><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">increment in the number of sources and the
        diversification of data integrated led to two primary </span><b>issues</b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">: </span></p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n<li style=\\\"list-style-type:
        none\\\">\\r\\n<ol style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\">\\r\\n<li>the necessity

        and</li>\\r\\n<li>the consequent possibility of encountering the same citation
        expressed by several sources with different identifiers.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">Moreover,
        it soon became evident the need to optimize the reuse of the already developed
        software components </span><b>to facilitate the metadata crosswalk processes
        between the new sources\u2019 data models and the OpenCitations Data Model</b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">, with </span><b>the aim to define a functional
        and easily extendable workflow</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\"> to
        be easily reused when it comes to incorporating new data sources, which should
        be:\_</span></p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n<li style=\\\"list-style-type: none\\\">\\r\\n<ol
        style=\\\"list-style-type: lower-alpha;text-align: justify\\\">\\r\\n<li><span

        unique procedure;\_</span></li>\\r\\n<li><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">customizable
        enough to capture the necessary information within each of the specific data
        models and formats.\_</span></li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">As
        a solution, we decided to use </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/3140\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">OpenCitations Meta</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">, the new OpenCitations database and tool for managing bibliographic
        data related to the publications involved in the citations. OpenCitations
        Meta makes it possible to assign each entity involved in a citation an internal
        identifier, nominally the OpenCitations Meta Identifier (OMID), to which all
        the associated persistent identifiers of the same publication are redirected.</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">As
        a result, the allocation of an OMID for each bibliographic resource also enabled
        the unambiguous identification of each citation, regardless of the persistent
        identifier schema originally used by the data source to identify the resources.
        This approach allowed us to perform data deduplication and finally make all
        the sources\u2019 contributions converge into </span><b>a unified index containing
        all the unique citations managed by OpenCitations, expressed as OMID to OMID
        citation links.</b></p>\\r\\n<h4 style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><b>The
        revised workflow</b></h4>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">The new workflow is based on </span><b>three
        main components</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\"> with the </span><b>benefit
        </b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">of optimizing the process both in
        terms of computational cost and in terms of flexibility. As shown in Fig.
        1, in a preliminary step, source-specific software converts the input dataset
        &#8211; structured according to the source data model &#8211; to extract two
        OpenCitations Data Model compliant data collections in tabular format for
        bibliographic metadata and citation data, respectively.</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">The
        following steps are common to the process of each dataset.\_\_</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><b>STEP 1</b><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">: The bibliographic metadata collection is used as input for the META
        software. At this stage, it is checked whether or not the bibliographic entities
        have been previously integrated into our infrastructure (coming from other
        data sources). If so, the existing OMID is linked also to the new alternative
        identifiers of the new bibliographic resources. New metadata values, if any,
        are also integrated. A new OMID identifier is produced for entities never
        previously encountered, uniquely representing the bibliographic resource in
        OpenCitations. The outputs of the process are: (I) an updated version of the
        OpenCitations Meta collection that also includes the metadata of the bibliographic
        entities provided by the new source, and (II) a collection of provenance data.
        An internal database is constantly refreshed to preserve correspondence between
        IDs and the associated internal OMIDs.</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:
        justify\\\"><b>STEP 2</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">: Starting from
        the collection of citations expressed as directional links between identifiers
        of potentially any type (e.g., DOI-DOI, PMID-PMID, PMC-PMID, etc.), the INDEX
        software queries the internal database mapping IDs to OMIDs to produce an
        updated version of the OpenCitations Index: unique citations expressed as
        OMID-OMID links in different formats, accompanied by their corresponding provenance
        data.</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\"

        and\\n    2.  the consequent possibility of encountering the same citation\\n
        \       expressed by several sources with different identifiers.\\n\\n[Moreover,
        it soon became evident the need to optimize the reuse of the\\nalready developed

        database and tool for managing bibliographic data\\nrelated to the publications
        involved in the citations. OpenCitations\\nMeta makes it possible to assign
        each entity involved in a citation an\\ninternal identifier, nominally the
        OpenCitations Meta Identifier (OMID),\\nto which all the associated persistent
        identifiers of the same\\npublication are redirected.]{style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\"}\\n\\n[As a result, the allocation of an OMID for each bibliographic
        resource\\nalso enabled the unambiguous identification of each citation, regardless\\nof
        the persistent identifier schema originally used by the data source\\nto identify
        the resources. This approach allowed us to perform data\\ndeduplication and

        As shown in Fig. 1, in a preliminary step,\\nsource-specific software converts
        the input dataset -- structured\\naccording to the source data model -- to
        extract two OpenCitations Data\\nModel compliant data collections in tabular
        format for bibliographic\\nmetadata and citation data, respectively.]{style=\\\"font-weight:

        400\\\"}\\n\\n**STEP 1**[: The bibliographic metadata collection is used as
        input for\\nthe META software. At this stage, it is checked whether or not
        the\\nbibliographic entities have been previously integrated into our\\ninfrastructure
        (coming from other data sources). If so, the existing\\nOMID is linked also
        to the new alternative identifiers of the new\\nbibliographic resources. New
        metadata values, if any, are also\\nintegrated. A new OMID identifier is produced
        for entities never\\npreviously encountered, uniquely representing the bibliographic
        resource\\nin OpenCitations. The outputs of the process are: (I) an updated
        version\\nof the OpenCitations Meta collection that also includes the metadata
        of\\nthe bibliographic entities provided by the new source, and (II) a\\ncollection
        of provenance data. An internal database is constantly\\nrefreshed to preserve
        correspondence between IDs and the associated\\ninternal OMIDs.]{style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\"}\\n\\n**STEP 2**[: Starting from the collection of citations expressed
        as\\ndirectional links between identifiers of potentially any type (e.g.,\\nDOI-DOI,
        PMID-PMID, PMC-PMID, etc.), the INDEX software queries the\\ninternal database
        mapping IDs to OMIDs to produce an updated version of\\nthe OpenCitations
        Index: unique citations expressed as OMID-OMID links\\nin different formats,

        Ryder </strong>(San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance IUCN-SSC Animal Biobanking

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">standards</a>) introduced
        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus

        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the

        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing

        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used

        A study of 31,821 populations representing 5,230\\nspecies monitored across
        the globe showed a 69% decline in abundance.\\nThe decline is disproportionate
        across the globe with the megadiverse\\ncontinent of Africa showing a 66%
        reduction in biodiversity, and Latin\\nAmerica and the Caribbean showing a
        staggering 94% reduction in\\nbiodiversity. The message is clear -- we have
        to act now to conserve our\\nliving planet.\\n\\nConservation is a key focus
        of the GGBN, and this network -- coordinated\\nby the GGBN Secretariat hosted
        and supported by the National Museum of\\nNatural History, Smithsonian Institution,

        Biobanking for\\nConservation.*\\n\\nThe term 'Data Standards' is used to
        describe a set of terms and\\ncontrolled vocabularies designed to represent
        facts about a\\nsample/voucher. An additional important concept pertinent
        to the focus\\nof GGBN is the \\\"Digital Extended Specimen\\\", which is
        a cloud of\\ninformation around a vouchered specimen and which can include
        genomic\\nsequence data and metabolomics data.\\n\\n### **One Plan Approach**
        {#one-plan-approach .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nIn his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder
        highlighted the need for a common\\nstandard of good practice and information
        sharing. Towards this end,\\nOliver showcased the \\\"One Plan Approach\\\"
        which was formulated at the\\nIUCN World Conservation Congress 2020 at its
        session in Marseille,\\nFrance, and which \\\"urges the Secretariat and professional
        societies to\\npromote integration of *in situ* and *ex situ* conservation\\ninterventions\\\"
        and \\\"to ensure effective use of all available\\nconservation tools\\\".\\n\\nOf
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN\\nCommissions and
        Members to \\\"enable and support establishment of a global\\nnetwork of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species\\nconservation targets and
        operating to common standards of good practice\\nand information sharing.\\\"\\n\\n###
        **Genetic Rescue and Cloning** {#genetic-rescue-and-cloning .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nOliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost\\namongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue\\ninvolves an increase
        in fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated\\nindividuals into small,
        declining populations, and we have [explored\\nthis topic\\npreviously](http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"} with our publication of the genome of the\\ncritically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver\\nhighlighted how genetic rescue
        has been successful in [increasing the\\nfitness of the Florida\\npanther](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"} *Puma* *concolor coryi*, by moving female\\npanthers from Texas
        to Florida from the mid-1990s.\\n\\nMuch more technically challenging is the
        use of cloning to increase\\ngenetic fitness in endangered species. Oliver
        was swift to point out\\nthat this approach has been used for the critically
        endangered\\nPrzewalski's horse. The [first cloned *Equus\\nprzewalskii*](https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer

        of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke of\\nSan Diego Zoo.\\n\\nIn
        the same year, a black-footed ferret named 'Elizabeth Ann' (born\\nDecember
        10, 2020) was [the first U.S. endangered species to be\\ncloned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer

        of viable cells and\\ngametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking, **Jackie\\nMackenzie-Dodds**
        (Natural History Museum, London) referred to the\\ncryopreservation facilities
        as a \\\"treasure trove of molecules\\\". Jackie\\npointed out that viable

        which aims at sharing the benefits arising from\\nthe utilisation of genetic
        resources in a fair and equitable way. One of\\nthe key features of the Nagoya
        Protocol agreement is that a permit is\\nrequired for gathering a specimen.
        From a GGBN perspective, it is a\\nrequirement to share this information with
        GGBN, where it is stored in\\nthe Darwin Core metadata associated with a sample.\\n\\nAs
        an illustrative example, **Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago** (Universidad\\nAut\xF3noma
        de Aguascalientes) focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates\\nto Mexico
        and explained, \\\"you need to get a permit of collect\\\". One of\\nthe reasons
        for a permit is to ensure the recognition of the collective\\nproperty of
        indigenous lands, and to ensure that allegations of\\nbiopiracy are excluded
        from genomic collections. As Jocelyn explained,\\n\\\"the heart of the Nagoya
        protocol is community consent -- informed\\nconsent from indigenous people\\\".\\n\\n<figure

        makes the consolidation even more extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers
        went from 47% of the market in 2000 to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest

        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access
        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such
        policies. The whole system rests on this logic of extraction and that&#8217;s
        what needs to be opposed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"Today's

        found that it&#8217;s a struggle to get people&#8217;s interest and that we
        have to be creative in order to educate about OA issues. Part of what I suspect

        people to participate in a workshop (there were over 20 people representing

        aktuellen Herausforderungen des wissenschaftlichen\\nPublikationswesens befasst.\\n\\nBereits
        im Vorfeld der Sitzung der Wissenschaftsministerien wurden\\nverschiedene
        Versionen der Erkl\xE4rung \xF6ffentlich diskutiert (siehe z.B.\\n[Science\\nBusiness](https://sciencebusiness.net/news/Universities/leaked-eu-member-states-set-out-reform-scientific-publishing)\\nund
        [Times Higher\\nEducation](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/can-eu-make-parallel-publishing-system-work)).\\nIm
        Kern stand die Frage, inwiefern das EU-Papier den Fokus auf\\nFinanzierungs-
        und Gesch\xE4ftsmodelle abseits von Publikationsgeb\xFChren\\n(Article Processing
        Charges, APCs) legt und ob sogar eine Abkehr von der\\nUnterst\xFCtzung dieses
        Modells durch die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa betont\\nwird.\\n\\nSchweden
        hatte das Thema im Rahmen seiner EU-Ratspr\xE4sidentschaft\\naugegriffen und
        bereits im\\n[Februar](https://wisspub.net/2023/02/10/eu-wissenschaftsministerien-erortern-open-science/)\\nin
        einem Hintergrund-Papier adressiert. Schon in diesem Briefing Paper\\nwurde
        die Problematik steigender Preise f\xFCr die wissenschaftlichen\\nFachinformation
        betont.\_\\n\\nIn der jetzt verabschiedeten Version der Schlussfolgerungen
        die\\nForderung nach sofortigem Open Access f\xFCr wissenschaftliche\\nPublikationen,
        die im Rahmen der \xF6ffentlich gef\xF6rderten Forschung\\nentstehen, nochmals
        betont. Dieses Ziel wurde [bereits\\n2016](https://wisspub.net/2016/05/27/eu-und-g7-staaten-setzen-auf-open-science/)\\nvon
        den EU-Wissenschaftsministerien erhoben. Die\\nWissenschaftsminister:innen
        hatten damals einen Open-Access-Anteil von\\n100 % bis 2020 gefordert. Dieser
        Wert wurde bisher jedoch nicht\\nerreicht. In Deutschland liegt der Open-Access-Anteil
        zum Beispiel bei\\n[63](https://open-access-monitor.de/) Prozent, w\xE4hrend

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im\\nBereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen\\nbetont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und\\nFinanzierungsmodellen, die
        weder die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen\\nfinanziell belasten und sich
        durch angemessene und transparente Preise\\nauszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird
        beklagt, dass die steigenden Preise f\xFCr\\nwissenschaftliche Fachinformationen
        zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren und die\\n\xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil
        der Forschung belasten (Punkt\\n5).\\n\\nAufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen
        Verlagswesen wird in zwei\\nbemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung
        von nicht\\ngewinnorientierten Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:\\n\\n\\\"The
        Council of the European Union \\\\[...\\\\] highlights the importance of\\nnot-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not\\ncharge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their\\nwork without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the\\nvariety of models that do not depend on
        article processing charges or\\nsimilar per-unit charges and stresses the
        importance of supporting the\\ndevelopment of such models led by public research
        organisations; \\\\[...\\\\]\\nstresses that it is essential to avoid situations
        where researchers are\\nlimited in their choice of publication channels due
        to financial\\ncapacities rather than quality criteria, and where access to
        research\\npublications is restricted by paywalls\\\"\\n\\nZwar sind diese
        Unterstreichung und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner\\nSchritt auf dem
        Weg zur Gestaltung eines pluralistischen, transparenten\\nund nachhaltigen
        Systems der digtialen Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie\\nkommen jedoch zu einem
        Zeitpunkt, zu dem die Kritik an dem Modell der\\nPublikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.\\n\\nErst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den\\nUSA,
        als Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker\\nEinrichtungen, das
        APC-Modell [deutlich\\nkritisiert](https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/).\\nDie
        Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren\\nUngleichheit
        f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut\\nausgestatteten Regionen
        beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt\\nwerden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.\\n\\nAuch hat der \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame\\n[R\xFCcktritt](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5)
        des\\nEditorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender\\nAPCs
        den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die\\nzur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues\\nJournal\\n[gegr\xFCndet](https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/),\\ndas
        niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das\\nProblem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.\\n\\nUm die im obrigen
        Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu\\nadressieren, soll die Koordinierung
        innerhalb der EU und mit globalen\\nPartnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung von Chancengleichheit
        im wissenschaftlichen\\nPublizieren gef\xF6rdert werden (Absatz 7). Hierzu
        sollen auch abgestimmte\\nFinanzierungsstrategien entwickelt werden, um die
        Anzahl von\\nnot-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly publishing
        models in\\nEurope with no costs for authors or readers\\\" signifikant zu
        erh\xF6hen\\n(Absatz 11).\\n\\nAuch soll das Anliegen durch eine m\xF6gliche
        Beteiligung der\\nEU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe (ORE), der von
        der\\nEU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr Autor:innen
        aus den\\nEU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).\_\\n\\nIn
        der\\n[Pressemitteilung](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/)\\nwerden
        weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen\\naugegriffen:\_\\n\\n\\\"Some
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into\\ntheir national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly\\npublications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national\\nopen access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications\\nimmediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions\\nacknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like\\nwithin the framework of the European
        Open Science Cloud (EOSC), and\\nsuggest including open science monitoring
        in the European Research Area\\nmonitoring mechanism.\\\"\\n\\nDie Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des\\nwissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer\\nTr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu\\nbegr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote\\nund
        -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder\\ngemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig\\nzu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf\\ninternationaler
        Ebene zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Daf\xFCr sind, wie das\\nPapier richtig
        betont, abgestimmte F\xF6rderaktivit\xE4ten erforderlich, die\\nbeispielsweise
        in Deutschland, komplement\xE4r zu DEAL, dem\\nwissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizieren

        the British Library has been affected by a significant cyberattack. Many of
        the digital services it provides have gone down and stayed down for many weeks
        now, whilst investigations take place. I have a lot of sympathy for the BL
        staff. As has been <a href=\\\"https://hcommons.social/@mia/111483661298025928\\\">observed</a>,
        public services can be a relatively easy target.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Two of
        the very wide variety of digital services that the BL provide, that I have

        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Both of these services, and many others (do we even know
        how many?) are still offline at the time of writing this (2023-11-30). I can
        probably live without registering a new ISSN, that can wait. But what about
        access to my PhD thesis? I want people to be able to read this. Is it still
        available online anywhere? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>My thesis EThOS ID is: uk.bl.ethos.64202

        got me thinking again about the major &#8216;Atyponocalypse&#8217; downtime
        event of 17th December 2020. Do you remember it? I certainly do (the screenshot
        above is from that event). The journal hosting platforms of SAGE, ACS Publications,
        Wiley, Taylor &amp; Francis and many others all simultaneously went offline
        for roughly a 24 hour period because of an error at <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon\\\">Atypon</a>,
        the publishing platform that many different legacy publishers use. It was
        unprecedented. People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of important
        knowledge were made almost completely digitally unavailable, worldwide. I
        like how <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185\\\">Brie</a>
        put it, at the time:<br><br>&#8220;One day left for student finals and Wiley&#8217;s
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites are all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and consolidations of academic knowledge again?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click\\\">#WileyDown</a>&#8221;
        (and that was the numbers for just <em>one</em> publisher)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        interesting thing about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for much of
        the content affected, there was no alternative, legal platform hosting the
        content in parallel.  Nor could people put online temporary copies to help
        students and researchers access the content they urgently needed &#8211; because
        of the copyright restrictions on that content. Many of the legacy publishers,
        for their paywalled journals (only), still have this major single-point-of-failure
        weakness.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But open access content does NOT suffer these
        weaknesses.<br><br>As I allude to in the title of this post. The key differentiators
        here in open access systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime
        overall are a) availability on multiple independent platforms and b) open
        licencing that makes it legally easier to host content in multiple places.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tools
        such as Google Scholar, <a href=\\\"https://openalex.org/\\\">OpenAlex</a>,
        and <a href=\\\"https://www.base-search.net/\\\">BASE</a> can signpost the
        way to where these alternative copies live. Research can stay openly accessible
        24/7, 365 days a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed and thus easy
        to host on multiple platforms.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Even if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g. <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/\\\">Michigan</a>
        recently) experience some downtime through cyberattacks or &#8216;unplanned
        maintainence&#8217;, the global collective network of repositories can ensure
        that the scholarship remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different locations.
        \ <strong>The next time you see a paywalled journal experiencing some significant
        downtime, please let me know.</strong> I think there are some very interesting
        natural obervation experiments that could be done around these events to tease
        out the differences in impact between open-licensed and &#8216;all rights
        reserved&#8217; content.  Does anyone maintain a wiki or database of major
        downtime events at academic publishers? There have been quite a few already&#8230;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        British Library has been affected by a significant cyberattack. Many\\nof

        of these services, and many others (do we even know how many?) are\\nstill
        offline at the time of writing this (2023-11-30). I can probably\\nlive without
        registering a new ISSN, that can wait. But what about\\naccess to my PhD thesis?
        I want people to be able to read this. Is it\\nstill available online anywhere?\\n\\nMy

        has been enriched with numerous new indexes of open citation data from different
        sources. However, the quantity and diversification of the ingested information
        have raised several issues, which recently made it essential to conduct a
        complete revision of the ingestion workflow. The result was a revolution in
        the way OpenCitations data is delivered. In this blog post, we will explain
        the context and challenges raised by the old procedure. Then, we will present
        the new ingestion workflow, designed to produce </span><b>just two comprehensive
        collections</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">:</span><b> OpenCitations
        Index</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">, collecting open citation data,

        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">In
        2018, OpenCitations released the kickoff version of its first citation index,
        </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/961\\\"><b>COCI </b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">(citations from Crossref)</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">, which contained around 300 million citation links derived from the
        subset of the reference lists in the Crossref database, where citing and cited
        entities were identified using Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). COCI gathered
        citations with associated metadata in compliance with the recommendations
        from the Initiative for Open Citations (</span><a href=\\\"https://i4oc.org/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">I4OC</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">) that citation data should be structured, separable, and open, thus
        marking a turning point by providing a disruptive and free and open alternative
        to earlier sources such as Google Scholar, which provided freely accessible
        data although not downloadable, and Web of Science or Scopus, which demanded
        paid access.\_</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">In a short time, COCI became a competitive
        and trusted index of citation data, used by numerous institutional repositories,
        including </span><a href=\\\"https://service.tib.eu/bison/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight:

        COCI was taken into account </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/1420\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">in a comparative study</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:

        ones, which showed its coverage approaching parity with those of the other
        sources involved in the analysis (Microsoft Academic, Scopus, Dimensions,
        and Web of Science). At the time of its most recent update in January 2023,
        COCI counted more than 1.4 billion citations. The reason behind this outstanding
        number lies in several factors, including </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/1165\\\"><span

        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">As
        a solution, we decided to use </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/3140\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">OpenCitations Meta</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">, the new OpenCitations database and tool for managing bibliographic
        data related to the publications involved in the citations. OpenCitations
        Meta makes it possible to assign each entity involved in a citation an internal
        identifier, nominally the OpenCitations Meta Identifier (OMID), to which all
        the associated persistent identifiers of the same publication are redirected.</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">As
        a result, the allocation of an OMID for each bibliographic resource also enabled
        the unambiguous identification of each citation, regardless of the persistent
        identifier schema originally used by the data source to identify the resources.
        This approach allowed us to perform data deduplication and finally make all
        the sources\u2019 contributions converge into </span><b>a unified index containing
        all the unique citations managed by OpenCitations, expressed as OMID to OMID
        citation links.</b></p>\\r\\n<h4 style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><b>The
        revised workflow</b></h4>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">The new workflow is based on </span><b>three
        main components</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\"> with the </span><b>benefit
        </b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">of optimizing the process both in
        terms of computational cost and in terms of flexibility. As shown in Fig.
        1, in a preliminary step, source-specific software converts the input dataset
        &#8211; structured according to the source data model &#8211; to extract two
        OpenCitations Data Model compliant data collections in tabular format for
        bibliographic metadata and citation data, respectively.</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">The
        following steps are common to the process of each dataset.\_\_</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><b>STEP 1</b><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">: The bibliographic metadata collection is used as input for the META
        software. At this stage, it is checked whether or not the bibliographic entities
        have been previously integrated into our infrastructure (coming from other
        data sources). If so, the existing OMID is linked also to the new alternative
        identifiers of the new bibliographic resources. New metadata values, if any,
        are also integrated. A new OMID identifier is produced for entities never
        previously encountered, uniquely representing the bibliographic resource in
        OpenCitations. The outputs of the process are: (I) an updated version of the
        OpenCitations Meta collection that also includes the metadata of the bibliographic
        entities provided by the new source, and (II) a collection of provenance data.
        An internal database is constantly refreshed to preserve correspondence between
        IDs and the associated internal OMIDs.</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:
        justify\\\"><b>STEP 2</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">: Starting from
        the collection of citations expressed as directional links between identifiers
        of potentially any type (e.g., DOI-DOI, PMID-PMID, PMC-PMID, etc.), the INDEX
        software queries the internal database mapping IDs to OMIDs to produce an
        updated version of the OpenCitations Index: unique citations expressed as
        OMID-OMID links in different formats, accompanied by their corresponding provenance
        data.</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\"

        database and tool for managing bibliographic data\\nrelated to the publications

        the input dataset -- structured\\naccording to the source data model -- to
        extract two OpenCitations Data\\nModel compliant data collections in tabular

        400\\\"}\\n\\n**STEP 1**[: The bibliographic metadata collection is used as
        input for\\nthe META software. At this stage, it is checked whether or not
        the\\nbibliographic entities have been previously integrated into our\\ninfrastructure
        (coming from other data sources). If so, the existing\\nOMID is linked also
        to the new alternative identifiers of the new\\nbibliographic resources. New
        metadata values, if any, are also\\nintegrated. A new OMID identifier is produced
        for entities never\\npreviously encountered, uniquely representing the bibliographic
        resource\\nin OpenCitations. The outputs of the process are: (I) an updated
        version\\nof the OpenCitations Meta collection that also includes the metadata
        of\\nthe bibliographic entities provided by the new source, and (II) a\\ncollection
        of provenance data. An internal database is constantly\\nrefreshed to preserve
        correspondence between IDs and the associated\\ninternal OMIDs.]{style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\"}\\n\\n**STEP 2**[: Starting from the collection of citations expressed
        as\\ndirectional links between identifiers of potentially any type (e.g.,\\nDOI-DOI,
        PMID-PMID, PMC-PMID, etc.), the INDEX software queries the\\ninternal database
        mapping IDs to OMIDs to produce an updated version of\\nthe OpenCitations

        the Global Decline in Biodiversity: The GGBN Perspective</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Oliver
        Ryder </strong>(San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance IUCN-SSC Animal Biobanking
        for Conservation Specialist Group, and <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1186/2047-217X-3-32\\\"

        \u2013 of which we have published many genomes and <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1186/2047-217X-1-8\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">standards</a>) introduced
        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN
        Secretariat hosted and supported by the National Museum of Natural History,
        Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC \u2013 aims to provide the necessary

        Ryder\u2019s keynote talk set the stage for Animal Biobanking for Conservation.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus
        przewalskii</em></a><em> </em>was foaled on August 6th 2020 and was named
        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells
        from Willa, a black-footed female ferret who died in the 1980s and who had
        no living descendants.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image is-resized\\\"><img

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate
        functioning iPSCs from frozen cell lines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        toolkit, and some of the challenges for conservation.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>From Fieldwork to BioBank</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Whereas
        there was clear focus on BioBanking at the GGBN conference, I was additionally
        interested to hear that GGBN standards are useful from a rewilding perspective.
        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental
        specimen metadata is used for decision making in projects such as the <a href=\\\"https://bethkaplin.org/current-projects/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">rewilding of Akagera
        National Park</a>. In this project \u2013 which is funded by the National
        Geographic Society \u2013 eDNA sampling of sediment cores and sample surface
        sediments are combined with natural history observations, and used to understand

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.

        A study of 31,821 populations representing 5,230\\nspecies monitored across
        the globe showed a 69% decline in abundance.\\nThe decline is disproportionate
        across the globe with the megadiverse\\ncontinent of Africa showing a 66%
        reduction in biodiversity, and Latin\\nAmerica and the Caribbean showing a
        staggering 94% reduction in\\nbiodiversity. The message is clear -- we have
        to act now to conserve our\\nliving planet.\\n\\nConservation is a key focus
        of the GGBN, and this network -- coordinated\\nby the GGBN Secretariat hosted
        and supported by the National Museum of\\nNatural History, Smithsonian Institution,

        Biobanking for\\nConservation.*\\n\\nThe term 'Data Standards' is used to
        describe a set of terms and\\ncontrolled vocabularies designed to represent
        facts about a\\nsample/voucher. An additional important concept pertinent
        to the focus\\nof GGBN is the \\\"Digital Extended Specimen\\\", which is
        a cloud of\\ninformation around a vouchered specimen and which can include
        genomic\\nsequence data and metabolomics data.\\n\\n### **One Plan Approach**
        {#one-plan-approach .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nIn his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder
        highlighted the need for a common\\nstandard of good practice and information
        sharing. Towards this end,\\nOliver showcased the \\\"One Plan Approach\\\"
        which was formulated at the\\nIUCN World Conservation Congress 2020 at its
        session in Marseille,\\nFrance, and which \\\"urges the Secretariat and professional
        societies to\\npromote integration of *in situ* and *ex situ* conservation\\ninterventions\\\"
        and \\\"to ensure effective use of all available\\nconservation tools\\\".\\n\\nOf
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN\\nCommissions and
        Members to \\\"enable and support establishment of a global\\nnetwork of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species\\nconservation targets and
        operating to common standards of good practice\\nand information sharing.\\\"\\n\\n###
        **Genetic Rescue and Cloning** {#genetic-rescue-and-cloning .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nOliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost\\namongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue\\ninvolves an increase
        in fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated\\nindividuals into small,
        declining populations, and we have [explored\\nthis topic\\npreviously](http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"} with our publication of the genome of the\\ncritically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver\\nhighlighted how genetic rescue
        has been successful in [increasing the\\nfitness of the Florida\\npanther](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"} *Puma* *concolor coryi*, by moving female\\npanthers from Texas
        to Florida from the mid-1990s.\\n\\nMuch more technically challenging is the
        use of cloning to increase\\ngenetic fitness in endangered species. Oliver
        was swift to point out\\nthat this approach has been used for the critically
        endangered\\nPrzewalski's horse. The [first cloned *Equus\\nprzewalskii*](https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer

        of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke of\\nSan Diego Zoo.\\n\\nIn
        the same year, a black-footed ferret named 'Elizabeth Ann' (born\\nDecember
        10, 2020) was [the first U.S. endangered species to be\\ncloned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer

        .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nA core focus of the GGBN conference was cryobanking
        of viable cells and\\ngametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking, **Jackie\\nMackenzie-Dodds**
        (Natural History Museum, London) referred to the\\ncryopreservation facilities
        as a \\\"treasure trove of molecules\\\". Jackie\\npointed out that viable
        cell lines are the most requested resource for\\nthe Natural History Museum
        BioBank, where they are used for the\\ngeneration of induced pluripotent stem
        cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.\\n\\nAnother important message from the GGBN
        conference was the need for Open\\nAccess BioBank facilities. Towards this

        **Mudzuli Mavhunga** of\\nBiodiversity Biobanks South Africa (South African
        National Biodiversity\\nInstitute, Pretoria). Mudzuli highlighted that, if

        eligible for\\nresource allocations through Biodiversity Biobanks South Africa
        (BBSA),\\nwhich is a great asset for a collection facility.\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        highlighted the example of passerines (perching\\nbirds) where programmed
        DNA loss is observed in some species. In\\npasserines such as the zebra finch
        (*Taeniopygia guttata*), there is a\\n[germ-line-restricted\\nchromosome](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer

        equine breeds,\\nincluding the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for which
        there are\\nonly 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis\\nhas created Nature's SAFE with the intention of applying this know-how\\nof
        rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been on\\nfield
        trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An\\nimportant
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South\\nAfrica stay in
        South Africa, which is both an ethical and legal\\nobligation (see Sharing
        of Genomic Collections under the Nagoya Protocol\\nbelow).\\n\\nTullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal\\nsamples, and the role
        of Nature's SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian\\ntissue from the pied tamarin
        (*Saguinus bicolor*, critically\\nendangered), the lar gibbon (*Hylobates
        lar*, endangered), and the\\ncheetah (*Acinonyx jubatus*, vulnerable). As
        Tullis explained, \\\"working\\nwith leading reproductive scientists and cryobiologists,
        we use\\nstate-of-the-art methods to preserve cells in a way that maintains\\nviability,

        which aims at sharing the benefits arising from\\nthe utilisation of genetic
        resources in a fair and equitable way. One of\\nthe key features of the Nagoya
        Protocol agreement is that a permit is\\nrequired for gathering a specimen.
        From a GGBN perspective, it is a\\nrequirement to share this information with
        GGBN, where it is stored in\\nthe Darwin Core metadata associated with a sample.\\n\\nAs
        an illustrative example, **Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago** (Universidad\\nAut\xF3noma

        for a permit is to ensure the recognition of the collective\\nproperty of
        indigenous lands, and to ensure that allegations of\\nbiopiracy are excluded
        from genomic collections. As Jocelyn explained,\\n\\\"the heart of the Nagoya

        <em>Scholarly Kitchen </em>blog post is an attempt by David Crotty &#8212;
        the blog&#8217;s editor &#8212; to quantify the increasing consolidation of
        the academic publishing industry. Crotty concludes:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p>Overall, the market has significantly consolidated
        since 2000 \u2014 when the top 5 publishers held 39% of the market of articles
        to 2022 where they control 61% of it. Looking at larger sets of publishers
        makes the consolidation even more extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers
        went from 47% of the market in 2000 to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest
        publishers from 54% to controlling 83% of the corpus.</p>\\n<cite>https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/10/30/quantifying-consolidation-in-the-scholarly-journals-market/</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s
        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access
        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such
        policies. The whole system rests on this logic of extraction and that&#8217;s
        what needs to be opposed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"Today's
        *Scholarly Kitchen* blog post is an attempt by David Crotty ---\\nthe blog's
        editor --- to quantify the increasing consolidation of the\\nacademic publishing
        industry. Crotty concludes:\\n\\n> Overall, the market has significantly consolidated
        since 2000 --- when\\n> the top 5 publishers held 39% of the market of articles
        to 2022 where\\n> they control 61% of it. Looking at larger sets of publishers
        makes the\\n> consolidation even more extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers
        went\\n> from 47% of the market in 2000 to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest\\n>
        publishers from 54% to controlling 83% of the corpus.\\n>\\n> https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/10/30/quantifying-consolidation-in-the-scholarly-journals-market/\\n\\nIt's
        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small\\nnumber of
        academic publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation\\nfrom the year
        2000 onwards, from the concentration brought about by the\\neffects of the
        Big Deal to the present day where 5 publishers now\\ncontrol 61% of the article
        output, brought about by the dominant\\nbusiness models for open access based
        on greater volume and\\ntechnological scale. The author's finger is pointed
        at Coalition S for\\ninstigating a 'rapid state of change' that allows author-pays
        open\\naccess to flourish.\\n\\nI'm no fan of open access policies, Plan S
        especially, and I'm sure that\\npolicy interventions play a part in the consolidation
        at play. There are\\nof course many ways of achieving open access without
        recourse to author\\nfees, transformative agreements, or technologies that
        remove human\\nexpertise in place of automation and scale. But while there
        is nothing\\nnatural or necessary about the relationship between open access
        and\\nconsolidation, there is a much stronger connection between\\ncommercialisation
        and consolidation. The recent history of academic\\npublishing has been of
        marketisation and, hence, consolidation.\\n\\nI always bristle when I read
        that open access is to blame for the\\nproblems with the publishing market,

        involve digital techniques are enabled by the various forms of open: open

        found that it&#8217;s a struggle to get people&#8217;s interest and that we
        have to be creative in order to educate about OA issues. Part of what I suspect
        makes advocating for OA difficult is the sort of singularity that comes from
        being &#8220;just the library,&#8221; the group that&#8217;s always talking
        about it. So when this Open Science Working Group formed, I was excited about

        on open science</a> in 2022. Later they established the working group by inviting
        people to participate in a workshop (there were over 20 people representing
        many disciplines). The workshop operated through a modified form of DORA&#8217;s
        <a href=\\\"https://sfdora.org/resource/workshop-toolkit-to-introduce-the-space-rubric/\\\">SPACE

        to bolster open scholarship throughout the university. It addresses many issues,

        principles, open education, resources, and more. Of course, this is not the
        end of the process. Among other things, next steps include focused discussions
        with department heads, administrators, and others. I imagine that getting

        aktuellen Herausforderungen des wissenschaftlichen\\nPublikationswesens befasst.\\n\\nBereits
        im Vorfeld der Sitzung der Wissenschaftsministerien wurden\\nverschiedene
        Versionen der Erkl\xE4rung \xF6ffentlich diskutiert (siehe z.B.\\n[Science\\nBusiness](https://sciencebusiness.net/news/Universities/leaked-eu-member-states-set-out-reform-scientific-publishing)\\nund
        [Times Higher\\nEducation](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/can-eu-make-parallel-publishing-system-work)).\\nIm
        Kern stand die Frage, inwiefern das EU-Papier den Fokus auf\\nFinanzierungs-
        und Gesch\xE4ftsmodelle abseits von Publikationsgeb\xFChren\\n(Article Processing
        Charges, APCs) legt und ob sogar eine Abkehr von der\\nUnterst\xFCtzung dieses
        Modells durch die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa betont\\nwird.\\n\\nSchweden
        hatte das Thema im Rahmen seiner EU-Ratspr\xE4sidentschaft\\naugegriffen und

        einem Hintergrund-Papier adressiert. Schon in diesem Briefing Paper\\nwurde
        die Problematik steigender Preise f\xFCr die wissenschaftlichen\\nFachinformation

        die\\nForderung nach sofortigem Open Access f\xFCr wissenschaftliche\\nPublikationen,
        die im Rahmen der \xF6ffentlich gef\xF6rderten Forschung\\nentstehen, nochmals

        den EU-Wissenschaftsministerien erhoben. Die\\nWissenschaftsminister:innen
        hatten damals einen Open-Access-Anteil von\\n100 % bis 2020 gefordert. Dieser
        Wert wurde bisher jedoch nicht\\nerreicht. In Deutschland liegt der Open-Access-Anteil
        zum Beispiel bei\\n[63](https://open-access-monitor.de/) Prozent, w\xE4hrend

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im\\nBereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen\\nbetont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und\\nFinanzierungsmodellen, die
        weder die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen\\nfinanziell belasten und sich
        durch angemessene und transparente Preise\\nauszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird
        beklagt, dass die steigenden Preise f\xFCr\\nwissenschaftliche Fachinformationen
        zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren und die\\n\xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil
        der Forschung belasten (Punkt\\n5).\\n\\nAufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen
        Verlagswesen wird in zwei\\nbemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung
        von nicht\\ngewinnorientierten Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:\\n\\n\\\"The
        Council of the European Union \\\\[...\\\\] highlights the importance of\\nnot-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not\\ncharge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their\\nwork without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the\\nvariety of models that do not depend on
        article processing charges or\\nsimilar per-unit charges and stresses the
        importance of supporting the\\ndevelopment of such models led by public research
        organisations; \\\\[...\\\\]\\nstresses that it is essential to avoid situations
        where researchers are\\nlimited in their choice of publication channels due
        to financial\\ncapacities rather than quality criteria, and where access to
        research\\npublications is restricted by paywalls\\\"\\n\\nZwar sind diese
        Unterstreichung und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner\\nSchritt auf dem
        Weg zur Gestaltung eines pluralistischen, transparenten\\nund nachhaltigen
        Systems der digtialen Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie\\nkommen jedoch zu einem
        Zeitpunkt, zu dem die Kritik an dem Modell der\\nPublikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.\\n\\nErst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den\\nUSA,
        als Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker\\nEinrichtungen, das
        APC-Modell [deutlich\\nkritisiert](https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/).\\nDie
        Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren\\nUngleichheit
        f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut\\nausgestatteten Regionen
        beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt\\nwerden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.\\n\\nAuch hat der \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame\\n[R\xFCcktritt](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5)
        des\\nEditorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender\\nAPCs
        den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die\\nzur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues\\nJournal\\n[gegr\xFCndet](https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/),\\ndas
        niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das\\nProblem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.\\n\\nUm die im obrigen
        Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu\\nadressieren, soll die Koordinierung
        innerhalb der EU und mit globalen\\nPartnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung von Chancengleichheit
        im wissenschaftlichen\\nPublizieren gef\xF6rdert werden (Absatz 7). Hierzu
        sollen auch abgestimmte\\nFinanzierungsstrategien entwickelt werden, um die
        Anzahl von\\nnot-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly publishing
        models in\\nEurope with no costs for authors or readers\\\" signifikant zu
        erh\xF6hen\\n(Absatz 11).\\n\\nAuch soll das Anliegen durch eine m\xF6gliche
        Beteiligung der\\nEU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe (ORE), der von
        der\\nEU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr Autor:innen
        aus den\\nEU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).\_\\n\\nIn
        der\\n[Pressemitteilung](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/)\\nwerden
        weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen\\naugegriffen:\_\\n\\n\\\"Some
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into\\ntheir national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly\\npublications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national\\nopen access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications\\nimmediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions\\nacknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like\\nwithin the framework of the European
        Open Science Cloud (EOSC), and\\nsuggest including open science monitoring
        in the European Research Area\\nmonitoring mechanism.\\\"\\n\\nDie Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des\\nwissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer\\nTr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu\\nbegr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote\\nund
        -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder\\ngemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig\\nzu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf\\ninternationaler
        Ebene zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Daf\xFCr sind, wie das\\nPapier richtig
        betont, abgestimmte F\xF6rderaktivit\xE4ten erforderlich, die\\nbeispielsweise

        you may have seen in the <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/22/personal-data-stolen-in-british-library-cyber-attack-appears-for-sale-online\\\">news</a>,
        the British Library has been affected by a significant cyberattack. Many of
        the digital services it provides have gone down and stayed down for many weeks
        now, whilst investigations take place. I have a lot of sympathy for the BL
        staff. As has been <a href=\\\"https://hcommons.social/@mia/111483661298025928\\\">observed</a>,
        public services can be a relatively easy target.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Two of
        the very wide variety of digital services that the BL provide, that I have
        a particular interest in are:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>a) the ISSN National Centre
        for the UK: <a href=\\\"https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html\\\">https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html</a><br>b)
        the E-Theses Online Service (EThOS): <a href=\\\"http://ethos.bl.uk/\\\">http://ethos.bl.uk/</a>
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Both of these services, and many others (do we even know
        how many?) are still offline at the time of writing this (2023-11-30). I can
        probably live without registering a new ISSN, that can wait. But what about
        access to my PhD thesis? I want people to be able to read this. Is it still
        available online anywhere? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>My thesis EThOS ID is: uk.bl.ethos.64202
        . In more normal times it would be publicly available via this link: <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022\\\">https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022</a>
        <br><br>Fortunately, because I retained my rights to it, my thesis is openly-licensed
        under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 licence, and copies of it can be
        uploaded wherever I want. As a consequence, my thesis is also available from
        the <a href=\\\"https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/comparative-cladistics-fossils-morphological-data-partitions-and-\\\">University

        highly likely that my thesis will always be accessible from somewhere on the
        internet 24/7, no matter what. Posting content in multiple independently-run
        places gives others access to that content in a highly <em>resilient</em>
        way. It is also worth mentioning, there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0165551510389358\\\">study</a>
        suggesting that OA content made available in multiple places gets cited more
        than OA content only available in one place.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        got me thinking again about the major &#8216;Atyponocalypse&#8217; downtime
        event of 17th December 2020. Do you remember it? I certainly do (the screenshot
        above is from that event). The journal hosting platforms of SAGE, ACS Publications,
        Wiley, Taylor &amp; Francis and many others all simultaneously went offline
        for roughly a 24 hour period because of an error at <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon\\\">Atypon</a>,
        the publishing platform that many different legacy publishers use. It was
        unprecedented. People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of important
        knowledge were made almost completely digitally unavailable, worldwide. I
        like how <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185\\\">Brie</a>
        put it, at the time:<br><br>&#8220;One day left for student finals and Wiley&#8217;s
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites are all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and consolidations of academic knowledge again?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click\\\">#WileyDown</a>&#8221;
        (and that was the numbers for just <em>one</em> publisher)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        interesting thing about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for much of
        the content affected, there was no alternative, legal platform hosting the
        content in parallel.  Nor could people put online temporary copies to help
        students and researchers access the content they urgently needed &#8211; because
        of the copyright restrictions on that content. Many of the legacy publishers,
        for their paywalled journals (only), still have this major single-point-of-failure
        weakness.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But open access content does NOT suffer these
        weaknesses.<br><br>As I allude to in the title of this post. The key differentiators
        here in open access systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime
        overall are a) availability on multiple independent platforms and b) open
        licencing that makes it legally easier to host content in multiple places.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tools
        such as Google Scholar, <a href=\\\"https://openalex.org/\\\">OpenAlex</a>,
        and <a href=\\\"https://www.base-search.net/\\\">BASE</a> can signpost the
        way to where these alternative copies live. Research can stay openly accessible
        24/7, 365 days a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed and thus easy
        to host on multiple platforms.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Even if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g. <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/\\\">Michigan</a>
        recently) experience some downtime through cyberattacks or &#8216;unplanned
        maintainence&#8217;, the global collective network of repositories can ensure
        that the scholarship remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different locations.
        \ <strong>The next time you see a paywalled journal experiencing some significant
        downtime, please let me know.</strong> I think there are some very interesting
        natural obervation experiments that could be done around these events to tease
        out the differences in impact between open-licensed and &#8216;all rights
        reserved&#8217; content.  Does anyone maintain a wiki or database of major
        downtime events at academic publishers? There have been quite a few already&#8230;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        the major 'Atyponocalypse' downtime\\nevent of 17th December 2020. Do you
        remember it? I certainly do (the\\nscreenshot above is from that event). The
        journal hosting platforms of\\nSAGE, ACS Publications, Wiley, Taylor & Francis
        and many others all\\nsimultaneously went offline for roughly a 24 hour period
        because of an\\nerror at [Atypon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon), the
        publishing\\nplatform that many different legacy publishers use. It was\\nunprecedented.
        People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of\\nimportant knowledge
        were made almost completely digitally unavailable,\\nworldwide. I like how\\n[Brie](https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185)
        put\\nit, at the time:  \\n  \\n\\\"One day left for student finals and Wiley's
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites\\nare all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and\\nconsolidations of academic knowledge again?\\\"  \\n  \\n\\\"1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with\\n[\\\\#WileyDown](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click)\\\"\\n(and
        that was the numbers for just *one* publisher)\\n\\nThe interesting thing
        about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for\\nmuch of the content affected,
        there was no alternative, legal platform\\nhosting the content in parallel.
        Nor could people put online temporary\\ncopies to help students and researchers
        access the content they urgently\\nneeded -- because of the copyright restrictions
        on that content. Many of\\nthe legacy publishers, for their paywalled journals
        (only), still have\\nthis major single-point-of-failure weakness.\\n\\nBut
        open access content does NOT suffer these weaknesses.  \\n  \\nAs I allude
        to in the title of this post. The key differentiators here\\nin open access
        systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime\\noverall are a)
        availability on multiple independent platforms and b)\\nopen licencing that
        makes it legally easier to host content in multiple\\nplaces.\\n\\nTools such
        as Google Scholar, [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/), and\\n[BASE](https://www.base-search.net/)
        can signpost the way to where these\\nalternative copies live. Research can
        stay openly accessible 24/7, 365\\ndays a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed
        and thus easy to host\\non multiple platforms.\\n\\nEven if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g.\\n[Michigan](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/)\\nrecently)
        experience some downtime through cyberattacks or 'unplanned\\nmaintainence',
        the global collective network of repositories can ensure\\nthat the scholarship
        remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different\\nlocations. **The next time
        you see a paywalled journal experiencing some\\nsignificant downtime, please
        let me know.** I think there are some very\\ninteresting natural obervation
        experiments that could be done around\\nthese events to tease out the differences
        in impact between\\nopen-licensed and 'all rights reserved' content. Does
        anyone maintain a\\nwiki or database of major downtime events at academic
        publishers? There\\nhave been quite a few already...\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        has been enriched with numerous new indexes of open citation data from different
        sources. However, the quantity and diversification of the ingested information
        have raised several issues, which recently made it essential to conduct a
        complete revision of the ingestion workflow. The result was a revolution in
        the way OpenCitations data is delivered. In this blog post, we will explain
        the context and challenges raised by the old procedure. Then, we will present
        the new ingestion workflow, designed to produce </span><b>just two comprehensive
        collections</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">:</span><b> OpenCitations
        Index</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">, collecting open citation data,
        and </span><b>OpenCitations Meta</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">,
        for the open bibliographical metadata.\_</span></p>\\r\\n<h4 style=\\\"text-align:
        justify\\\"><b>Once upon a time, there were five OpenCitations indexes\u2026</b></h4>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">In
        2018, OpenCitations released the kickoff version of its first citation index,
        </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/961\\\"><b>COCI </b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">(citations from Crossref)</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">, which contained around 300 million citation links derived from the
        subset of the reference lists in the Crossref database, where citing and cited
        entities were identified using Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). COCI gathered
        citations with associated metadata in compliance with the recommendations
        from the Initiative for Open Citations (</span><a href=\\\"https://i4oc.org/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">I4OC</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">) that citation data should be structured, separable, and open, thus
        marking a turning point by providing a disruptive and free and open alternative
        to earlier sources such as Google Scholar, which provided freely accessible
        data although not downloadable, and Web of Science or Scopus, which demanded
        paid access.\_</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">In a short time, COCI became a competitive
        and trusted index of citation data, used by numerous institutional repositories,
        including </span><a href=\\\"https://service.tib.eu/bison/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight:

        400\\\">Optimeta</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">. In 2021,
        COCI was taken into account </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/1420\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">in a comparative study</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\"> with the most relevant sources in the landscape, including the proprietary
        ones, which showed its coverage approaching parity with those of the other
        sources involved in the analysis (Microsoft Academic, Scopus, Dimensions,
        and Web of Science). At the time of its most recent update in January 2023,
        COCI counted more than 1.4 billion citations. The reason behind this outstanding
        number lies in several factors, including </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/1165\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">Elsevier\u2019s endorsement of the Declaration
        on Research Assessment (DORA) in December 2020</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">, leading to the open release via Crossref of the reference lists
        of the articles published in all its journals, and confirming the value of
        initiatives such as the </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/696\\\"><span

        justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">However, before this change
        of heart, in 2019 OpenCitations had tried to narrow the open citations coverage
        gap by launching its second index, the </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/944\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">Crowdsourced Open Citations Index (</span><b>CROCI</b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">)</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">.
        This index allowed publishers and scholars to contribute directly by uploading
        crowdsourced open citations into the OpenCitations infrastructure.</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">In
        December 2022, a new concrete step towards a factual plurality of OpenCitations
        indexes was taken by the ingestion of new data sources into the infrastructure,
        with the publication of the inaugural dumps of </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/3106\\\"><b>DOCI

        of five collections from different sources.\_</span></p>\\r\\n<h4 style=\\\"text-align:
        justify\\\"><b>Why a new workflow? The issues with multiple sources management
        and new challenges</b></h4>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">While having such a variety and richness of
        indexes helped present the extent of OpenCitations sources, the recent </span><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">increment in the number of sources and the
        diversification of data integrated led to two primary </span><b>issues</b><span

        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">Moreover,
        it soon became evident the need to optimize the reuse of the already developed
        software components </span><b>to facilitate the metadata crosswalk processes
        between the new sources\u2019 data models and the OpenCitations Data Model</b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">, with </span><b>the aim to define a functional
        and easily extendable workflow</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\"> to
        be easily reused when it comes to incorporating new data sources, which should
        be:\_</span></p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n<li style=\\\"list-style-type: none\\\">\\r\\n<ol

        enough to capture the necessary information within each of the specific data
        models and formats.\_</span></li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">As
        a solution, we decided to use </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/3140\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">OpenCitations Meta</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">, the new OpenCitations database and tool for managing bibliographic
        data related to the publications involved in the citations. OpenCitations
        Meta makes it possible to assign each entity involved in a citation an internal
        identifier, nominally the OpenCitations Meta Identifier (OMID), to which all
        the associated persistent identifiers of the same publication are redirected.</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">As
        a result, the allocation of an OMID for each bibliographic resource also enabled
        the unambiguous identification of each citation, regardless of the persistent
        identifier schema originally used by the data source to identify the resources.
        This approach allowed us to perform data deduplication and finally make all
        the sources\u2019 contributions converge into </span><b>a unified index containing
        all the unique citations managed by OpenCitations, expressed as OMID to OMID
        citation links.</b></p>\\r\\n<h4 style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><b>The
        revised workflow</b></h4>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">The new workflow is based on </span><b>three
        main components</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\"> with the </span><b>benefit
        </b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">of optimizing the process both in
        terms of computational cost and in terms of flexibility. As shown in Fig.
        1, in a preliminary step, source-specific software converts the input dataset
        &#8211; structured according to the source data model &#8211; to extract two
        OpenCitations Data Model compliant data collections in tabular format for
        bibliographic metadata and citation data, respectively.</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">The
        following steps are common to the process of each dataset.\_\_</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><b>STEP 1</b><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">: The bibliographic metadata collection is used as input for the META
        software. At this stage, it is checked whether or not the bibliographic entities
        have been previously integrated into our infrastructure (coming from other
        data sources). If so, the existing OMID is linked also to the new alternative
        identifiers of the new bibliographic resources. New metadata values, if any,
        are also integrated. A new OMID identifier is produced for entities never
        previously encountered, uniquely representing the bibliographic resource in
        OpenCitations. The outputs of the process are: (I) an updated version of the
        OpenCitations Meta collection that also includes the metadata of the bibliographic
        entities provided by the new source, and (II) a collection of provenance data.
        An internal database is constantly refreshed to preserve correspondence between
        IDs and the associated internal OMIDs.</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:
        justify\\\"><b>STEP 2</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">: Starting from
        the collection of citations expressed as directional links between identifiers
        of potentially any type (e.g., DOI-DOI, PMID-PMID, PMC-PMID, etc.), the INDEX
        software queries the internal database mapping IDs to OMIDs to produce an
        updated version of the OpenCitations Index: unique citations expressed as
        OMID-OMID links in different formats, accompanied by their corresponding provenance
        data.</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\"

        to the new alternative identifiers of the new\\nbibliographic resources. New
        metadata values, if any, are also\\nintegrated. A new OMID identifier is produced
        for entities never\\npreviously encountered, uniquely representing the bibliographic
        resource\\nin OpenCitations. The outputs of the process are: (I) an updated
        version\\nof the OpenCitations Meta collection that also includes the metadata
        of\\nthe bibliographic entities provided by the new source, and (II) a\\ncollection
        of provenance data. An internal database is constantly\\nrefreshed to preserve
        correspondence between IDs and the associated\\ninternal OMIDs.]{style=\\\"font-weight:

        as\\ndirectional links between identifiers of potentially any type (e.g.,\\nDOI-DOI,

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">standards</a>) introduced
        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus
        przewalskii</em></a><em> </em>was foaled on August 6th 2020 and was named
        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank

        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,

        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally

        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core

        A study of 31,821 populations representing 5,230\\nspecies monitored across
        the globe showed a 69% decline in abundance.\\nThe decline is disproportionate
        across the globe with the megadiverse\\ncontinent of Africa showing a 66%
        reduction in biodiversity, and Latin\\nAmerica and the Caribbean showing a
        staggering 94% reduction in\\nbiodiversity. The message is clear -- we have
        to act now to conserve our\\nliving planet.\\n\\nConservation is a key focus
        of the GGBN, and this network -- coordinated\\nby the GGBN Secretariat hosted
        and supported by the National Museum of\\nNatural History, Smithsonian Institution,

        facts about a\\nsample/voucher. An additional important concept pertinent
        to the focus\\nof GGBN is the \\\"Digital Extended Specimen\\\", which is
        a cloud of\\ninformation around a vouchered specimen and which can include
        genomic\\nsequence data and metabolomics data.\\n\\n### **One Plan Approach**
        {#one-plan-approach .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nIn his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder
        highlighted the need for a common\\nstandard of good practice and information
        sharing. Towards this end,\\nOliver showcased the \\\"One Plan Approach\\\"
        which was formulated at the\\nIUCN World Conservation Congress 2020 at its
        session in Marseille,\\nFrance, and which \\\"urges the Secretariat and professional
        societies to\\npromote integration of *in situ* and *ex situ* conservation\\ninterventions\\\"
        and \\\"to ensure effective use of all available\\nconservation tools\\\".\\n\\nOf
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN\\nCommissions and
        Members to \\\"enable and support establishment of a global\\nnetwork of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species\\nconservation targets and
        operating to common standards of good practice\\nand information sharing.\\\"\\n\\n###
        **Genetic Rescue and Cloning** {#genetic-rescue-and-cloning .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nOliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost\\namongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue\\ninvolves an increase
        in fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated\\nindividuals into small,
        declining populations, and we have [explored\\nthis topic\\npreviously](http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"} with our publication of the genome of the\\ncritically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver\\nhighlighted how genetic rescue
        has been successful in [increasing the\\nfitness of the Florida\\npanther](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"} *Puma* *concolor coryi*, by moving female\\npanthers from Texas
        to Florida from the mid-1990s.\\n\\nMuch more technically challenging is the
        use of cloning to increase\\ngenetic fitness in endangered species. Oliver
        was swift to point out\\nthat this approach has been used for the critically
        endangered\\nPrzewalski's horse. The [first cloned *Equus\\nprzewalskii*](https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer

        of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke of\\nSan Diego Zoo.\\n\\nIn
        the same year, a black-footed ferret named 'Elizabeth Ann' (born\\nDecember
        10, 2020) was [the first U.S. endangered species to be\\ncloned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer

        of viable cells and\\ngametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking, **Jackie\\nMackenzie-Dodds**
        (Natural History Museum, London) referred to the\\ncryopreservation facilities
        as a \\\"treasure trove of molecules\\\". Jackie\\npointed out that viable

        equine breeds,\\nincluding the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for which
        there are\\nonly 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis\\nhas created Nature's SAFE with the intention of applying this know-how\\nof
        rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been on\\nfield
        trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An\\nimportant
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South\\nAfrica stay in
        South Africa, which is both an ethical and legal\\nobligation (see Sharing
        of Genomic Collections under the Nagoya Protocol\\nbelow).\\n\\nTullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal\\nsamples, and the role
        of Nature's SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian\\ntissue from the pied tamarin
        (*Saguinus bicolor*, critically\\nendangered), the lar gibbon (*Hylobates
        lar*, endangered), and the\\ncheetah (*Acinonyx jubatus*, vulnerable). As
        Tullis explained, \\\"working\\nwith leading reproductive scientists and cryobiologists,
        we use\\nstate-of-the-art methods to preserve cells in a way that maintains\\nviability,
        allowing them to be thawed and used to establish pregnancies,\\nrestoring

        which aims at sharing the benefits arising from\\nthe utilisation of genetic
        resources in a fair and equitable way. One of\\nthe key features of the Nagoya
        Protocol agreement is that a permit is\\nrequired for gathering a specimen.
        From a GGBN perspective, it is a\\nrequirement to share this information with
        GGBN, where it is stored in\\nthe Darwin Core metadata associated with a sample.\\n\\nAs
        an illustrative example, **Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago** (Universidad\\nAut\xF3noma

        for a permit is to ensure the recognition of the collective\\nproperty of
        indigenous lands, and to ensure that allegations of\\nbiopiracy are excluded

        makes the consolidation even more extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers
        went from 47% of the market in 2000 to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest

        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access
        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such
        policies. The whole system rests on this logic of extraction and that&#8217;s

        found that it&#8217;s a struggle to get people&#8217;s interest and that we
        have to be creative in order to educate about OA issues. Part of what I suspect
        makes advocating for OA difficult is the sort of singularity that comes from
        being &#8220;just the library,&#8221; the group that&#8217;s always talking
        about it. So when this Open Science Working Group formed, I was excited about

        on open science</a> in 2022. Later they established the working group by inviting
        people to participate in a workshop (there were over 20 people representing
        many disciplines). The workshop operated through a modified form of DORA&#8217;s
        <a href=\\\"https://sfdora.org/resource/workshop-toolkit-to-introduce-the-space-rubric/\\\">SPACE
        rubric</a>, which was designed for academic institutions to use toward improving
        their policies. I think using that tool to organize such a large group of
        people toward a practical outcome was extremely beneficial. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        more meetings, discussions, and revisions the working group was able to produce
        a set of <a href=\\\"https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/id/eprint/992647/\\\">recommendations</a>
        to bolster open scholarship throughout the university. It addresses many issues,
        including existing policies, outreach, inter-institutional work, position
        principles, open education, resources, and more. Of course, this is not the
        end of the process. Among other things, next steps include focused discussions
        with department heads, administrators, and others. I imagine that getting
        to a place where open scholarship/open science is well-understood and hopefully
        a default institutional position for research and education will require ongoing

        bolster open scholarship throughout the university. It addresses many\\nissues,
        including existing policies, outreach, inter-institutional work,\\nposition
        principles, open education, resources, and more. Of course,\\nthis is not
        the end of the process. Among other things, next steps\\ninclude focused discussions
        with department heads, administrators, and\\nothers. I imagine that getting
        to a place where open scholarship/open\\nscience is well-understood and hopefully
        a default institutional\\nposition for research and education will require
        ongoing work.\\n\\nThe recommendations in the report tend to be specific within
        the context\\nof Concordia University but I felt it worthwhile to write about
        here\\nbecause the process, the findings, and the recommendations may be of\\ninterest
        to others. Perhaps you would like to try something similar at\\nyour institution?
        The Concordia work could be one model to reflect on\\nwhat would work well
        or not so well in your own context.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/pk905-p9r05\",\"guid\":\"https://chroknowlogy.ca/?p=64616\",\"id\":\"b11b28bb-f44a-4dc7-a3ea-3917c603e3ef\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1692993161,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"The

        im Vorfeld der Sitzung der Wissenschaftsministerien wurden\\nverschiedene
        Versionen der Erkl\xE4rung \xF6ffentlich diskutiert (siehe z.B.\\n[Science\\nBusiness](https://sciencebusiness.net/news/Universities/leaked-eu-member-states-set-out-reform-scientific-publishing)\\nund
        [Times Higher\\nEducation](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/can-eu-make-parallel-publishing-system-work)).\\nIm

        und Gesch\xE4ftsmodelle abseits von Publikationsgeb\xFChren\\n(Article Processing
        Charges, APCs) legt und ob sogar eine Abkehr von der\\nUnterst\xFCtzung dieses
        Modells durch die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa betont\\nwird.\\n\\nSchweden
        hatte das Thema im Rahmen seiner EU-Ratspr\xE4sidentschaft\\naugegriffen und
        bereits im\\n[Februar](https://wisspub.net/2023/02/10/eu-wissenschaftsministerien-erortern-open-science/)\\nin
        einem Hintergrund-Papier adressiert. Schon in diesem Briefing Paper\\nwurde

        den EU-Wissenschaftsministerien erhoben. Die\\nWissenschaftsminister:innen
        hatten damals einen Open-Access-Anteil von\\n100 % bis 2020 gefordert. Dieser
        Wert wurde bisher jedoch nicht\\nerreicht. In Deutschland liegt der Open-Access-Anteil

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im\\nBereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen\\nbetont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und\\nFinanzierungsmodellen, die
        weder die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen\\nfinanziell belasten und sich
        durch angemessene und transparente Preise\\nauszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird
        beklagt, dass die steigenden Preise f\xFCr\\nwissenschaftliche Fachinformationen
        zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren und die\\n\xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil
        der Forschung belasten (Punkt\\n5).\\n\\nAufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen
        Verlagswesen wird in zwei\\nbemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung
        von nicht\\ngewinnorientierten Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:\\n\\n\\\"The
        Council of the European Union \\\\[...\\\\] highlights the importance of\\nnot-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not\\ncharge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their\\nwork without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the\\nvariety of models that do not depend on
        article processing charges or\\nsimilar per-unit charges and stresses the
        importance of supporting the\\ndevelopment of such models led by public research
        organisations; \\\\[...\\\\]\\nstresses that it is essential to avoid situations
        where researchers are\\nlimited in their choice of publication channels due
        to financial\\ncapacities rather than quality criteria, and where access to
        research\\npublications is restricted by paywalls\\\"\\n\\nZwar sind diese
        Unterstreichung und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner\\nSchritt auf dem
        Weg zur Gestaltung eines pluralistischen, transparenten\\nund nachhaltigen
        Systems der digtialen Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie\\nkommen jedoch zu einem
        Zeitpunkt, zu dem die Kritik an dem Modell der\\nPublikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.\\n\\nErst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den\\nUSA,
        als Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker\\nEinrichtungen, das
        APC-Modell [deutlich\\nkritisiert](https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/).\\nDie
        Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren\\nUngleichheit
        f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut\\nausgestatteten Regionen
        beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt\\nwerden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.\\n\\nAuch hat der \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame\\n[R\xFCcktritt](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5)
        des\\nEditorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender\\nAPCs
        den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die\\nzur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues\\nJournal\\n[gegr\xFCndet](https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/),\\ndas
        niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das\\nProblem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.\\n\\nUm die im obrigen
        Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu\\nadressieren, soll die Koordinierung
        innerhalb der EU und mit globalen\\nPartnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung von Chancengleichheit
        im wissenschaftlichen\\nPublizieren gef\xF6rdert werden (Absatz 7). Hierzu
        sollen auch abgestimmte\\nFinanzierungsstrategien entwickelt werden, um die
        Anzahl von\\nnot-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly publishing
        models in\\nEurope with no costs for authors or readers\\\" signifikant zu
        erh\xF6hen\\n(Absatz 11).\\n\\nAuch soll das Anliegen durch eine m\xF6gliche
        Beteiligung der\\nEU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe (ORE), der von
        der\\nEU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr Autor:innen
        aus den\\nEU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).\_\\n\\nIn
        der\\n[Pressemitteilung](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/)\\nwerden
        weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen\\naugegriffen:\_\\n\\n\\\"Some
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into\\ntheir national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly\\npublications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national\\nopen access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications\\nimmediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions\\nacknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like\\nwithin the framework of the European
        Open Science Cloud (EOSC), and\\nsuggest including open science monitoring
        in the European Research Area\\nmonitoring mechanism.\\\"\\n\\nDie Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des\\nwissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer\\nTr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu\\nbegr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote\\nund
        -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder\\ngemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig\\nzu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf\\ninternationaler
        Ebene zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Daf\xFCr sind, wie das\\nPapier richtig
        betont, abgestimmte F\xF6rderaktivit\xE4ten erforderlich, die\\nbeispielsweise

        now, whilst investigations take place. I have a lot of sympathy for the BL
        staff. As has been <a href=\\\"https://hcommons.social/@mia/111483661298025928\\\">observed</a>,
        public services can be a relatively easy target.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Two of
        the very wide variety of digital services that the BL provide, that I have
        a particular interest in are:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>a) the ISSN National Centre
        for the UK: <a href=\\\"https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html\\\">https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html</a><br>b)
        the E-Theses Online Service (EThOS): <a href=\\\"http://ethos.bl.uk/\\\">http://ethos.bl.uk/</a>
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Both of these services, and many others (do we even know
        how many?) are still offline at the time of writing this (2023-11-30). I can
        probably live without registering a new ISSN, that can wait. But what about
        access to my PhD thesis? I want people to be able to read this. Is it still
        available online anywhere? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>My thesis EThOS ID is: uk.bl.ethos.64202
        . In more normal times it would be publicly available via this link: <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022\\\">https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022</a>
        <br><br>Fortunately, because I retained my rights to it, my thesis is openly-licensed
        under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 licence, and copies of it can be
        uploaded wherever I want. As a consequence, my thesis is also available from
        the <a href=\\\"https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/comparative-cladistics-fossils-morphological-data-partitions-and-\\\">University
        of Bath institutional repository</a>, <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.31237/osf.io/7sa6d\\\">Thesis
        Commons</a>. , <a href=\\\"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/161921158.pdf\\\">CORE</a>,

        Archive</a>. Even if one or two of these repositories goes down, it&#8217;s
        highly likely that my thesis will always be accessible from somewhere on the
        internet 24/7, no matter what. Posting content in multiple independently-run
        places gives others access to that content in a highly <em>resilient</em>
        way. It is also worth mentioning, there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0165551510389358\\\">study</a>
        suggesting that OA content made available in multiple places gets cited more
        than OA content only available in one place.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        got me thinking again about the major &#8216;Atyponocalypse&#8217; downtime
        event of 17th December 2020. Do you remember it? I certainly do (the screenshot
        above is from that event). The journal hosting platforms of SAGE, ACS Publications,
        Wiley, Taylor &amp; Francis and many others all simultaneously went offline
        for roughly a 24 hour period because of an error at <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon\\\">Atypon</a>,
        the publishing platform that many different legacy publishers use. It was
        unprecedented. People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of important
        knowledge were made almost completely digitally unavailable, worldwide. I
        like how <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185\\\">Brie</a>
        put it, at the time:<br><br>&#8220;One day left for student finals and Wiley&#8217;s
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites are all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and consolidations of academic knowledge again?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click\\\">#WileyDown</a>&#8221;
        (and that was the numbers for just <em>one</em> publisher)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        interesting thing about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for much of
        the content affected, there was no alternative, legal platform hosting the
        content in parallel.  Nor could people put online temporary copies to help
        students and researchers access the content they urgently needed &#8211; because
        of the copyright restrictions on that content. Many of the legacy publishers,
        for their paywalled journals (only), still have this major single-point-of-failure
        weakness.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But open access content does NOT suffer these
        weaknesses.<br><br>As I allude to in the title of this post. The key differentiators
        here in open access systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime
        overall are a) availability on multiple independent platforms and b) open
        licencing that makes it legally easier to host content in multiple places.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tools
        such as Google Scholar, <a href=\\\"https://openalex.org/\\\">OpenAlex</a>,
        and <a href=\\\"https://www.base-search.net/\\\">BASE</a> can signpost the
        way to where these alternative copies live. Research can stay openly accessible
        24/7, 365 days a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed and thus easy
        to host on multiple platforms.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Even if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g. <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/\\\">Michigan</a>
        recently) experience some downtime through cyberattacks or &#8216;unplanned
        maintainence&#8217;, the global collective network of repositories can ensure
        that the scholarship remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different locations.
        \ <strong>The next time you see a paywalled journal experiencing some significant
        downtime, please let me know.</strong> I think there are some very interesting
        natural obervation experiments that could be done around these events to tease
        out the differences in impact between open-licensed and &#8216;all rights
        reserved&#8217; content.  Does anyone maintain a wiki or database of major
        downtime events at academic publishers? There have been quite a few already&#8230;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        the way OpenCitations data is delivered. In this blog post, we will explain
        the context and challenges raised by the old procedure. Then, we will present

        subset of the reference lists in the Crossref database, where citing and cited

        marking a turning point by providing a disruptive and free and open alternative

        and new challenges</b></h4>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">While having such a variety and richness of
        indexes helped present the extent of OpenCitations sources, the recent </span><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">increment in the number of sources and the
        diversification of data integrated led to two primary </span><b>issues</b><span

        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">Moreover,
        it soon became evident the need to optimize the reuse of the already developed
        software components </span><b>to facilitate the metadata crosswalk processes
        between the new sources\u2019 data models and the OpenCitations Data Model</b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">, with </span><b>the aim to define a functional
        and easily extendable workflow</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\"> to
        be easily reused when it comes to incorporating new data sources, which should

        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">As
        a solution, we decided to use </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/3140\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">OpenCitations Meta</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">, the new OpenCitations database and tool for managing bibliographic
        data related to the publications involved in the citations. OpenCitations
        Meta makes it possible to assign each entity involved in a citation an internal
        identifier, nominally the OpenCitations Meta Identifier (OMID), to which all
        the associated persistent identifiers of the same publication are redirected.</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">As
        a result, the allocation of an OMID for each bibliographic resource also enabled
        the unambiguous identification of each citation, regardless of the persistent
        identifier schema originally used by the data source to identify the resources.
        This approach allowed us to perform data deduplication and finally make all
        the sources\u2019 contributions converge into </span><b>a unified index containing
        all the unique citations managed by OpenCitations, expressed as OMID to OMID
        citation links.</b></p>\\r\\n<h4 style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><b>The
        revised workflow</b></h4>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">The new workflow is based on </span><b>three
        main components</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\"> with the </span><b>benefit
        </b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">of optimizing the process both in
        terms of computational cost and in terms of flexibility. As shown in Fig.
        1, in a preliminary step, source-specific software converts the input dataset
        &#8211; structured according to the source data model &#8211; to extract two
        OpenCitations Data Model compliant data collections in tabular format for
        bibliographic metadata and citation data, respectively.</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">The
        following steps are common to the process of each dataset.\_\_</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><b>STEP 1</b><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">: The bibliographic metadata collection is used as input for the META
        software. At this stage, it is checked whether or not the bibliographic entities
        have been previously integrated into our infrastructure (coming from other
        data sources). If so, the existing OMID is linked also to the new alternative
        identifiers of the new bibliographic resources. New metadata values, if any,
        are also integrated. A new OMID identifier is produced for entities never
        previously encountered, uniquely representing the bibliographic resource in
        OpenCitations. The outputs of the process are: (I) an updated version of the
        OpenCitations Meta collection that also includes the metadata of the bibliographic
        entities provided by the new source, and (II) a collection of provenance data.
        An internal database is constantly refreshed to preserve correspondence between
        IDs and the associated internal OMIDs.</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:
        justify\\\"><b>STEP 2</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">: Starting from
        the collection of citations expressed as directional links between identifiers
        of potentially any type (e.g., DOI-DOI, PMID-PMID, PMC-PMID, etc.), the INDEX
        software queries the internal database mapping IDs to OMIDs to produce an
        updated version of the OpenCitations Index: unique citations expressed as
        OMID-OMID links in different formats, accompanied by their corresponding provenance
        data.</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\"

        to the new alternative identifiers of the new\\nbibliographic resources. New
        metadata values, if any, are also\\nintegrated. A new OMID identifier is produced
        for entities never\\npreviously encountered, uniquely representing the bibliographic
        resource\\nin OpenCitations. The outputs of the process are: (I) an updated
        version\\nof the OpenCitations Meta collection that also includes the metadata
        of\\nthe bibliographic entities provided by the new source, and (II) a\\ncollection

        problems of their experimental design.\\n\\nThe experience as a reviewer was
        like arriving at the scene of a car\\ncrash six months too late to stop the
        accident. To change this piece of\\nwork into one with an acceptable experimental
        design at this point would\\nbe a LOT of new work and might require throwing
        away much of the\\nexisting data.\\n\\nIt's clear to me that a lot of researchers
        are now trying their hand at\\nmetaresearch, research on research, journalology,
        and open access\\nstudies --- whatever you call it. That's great. But I implore
        folks to\\nseriously consider getting their experimental design peer-reviewed\\nBEFORE

        more stage 1 registered reports in metaresearch, to\\ncatch improperly designed

        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus

        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate
        functioning iPSCs from frozen cell lines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        there was clear focus on BioBanking at the GGBN conference, I was additionally
        interested to hear that GGBN standards are useful from a rewilding perspective.
        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.

        *\\\"Extinction is forever -- so our action must be immediate.\\\"*  \\n>
        --*Sir David Attenborough, Sept 30th 2020*\\n\\nThe fourth international [Global
        Genome Biodiversity Network (GGBN)\\nConference](https://ggbn2023.weebly.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"} took place in Aguascalientes, Mexico from\\nOctober 17th to
        October 20th 2023 where it was hosted by the Universidad\\nAut\xF3noma de
        Aguascalientes. The\\n[GGBN](https://www.ggbn.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"}\\nis a global network of collections of genomic
        samples from across the\\nTree of Life, whose mission is to foster collaborations
        among\\nbiodiversity and biobanking repositories in order to ensure quality\\nstandards
        and harmonise exchange of material in accordance with national\\nand international
        legislation and conventions. GigaScience Press Data\\nScientist Chris Armit
        attended the conference and reports below on some\\nof the highlights.\\n\\n###
        **Confronting the Global Decline in Biodiversity: The GGBN Perspective** {#confronting-the-global-decline-in-biodiversity-the-ggbn-perspective
        .wp-block-heading}\\n\\n**Oliver Ryder** (San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance
        IUCN-SSC Animal\\nBiobanking for Conservation Specialist Group, and [co-founder
        of\\nGenome10K](https://doi.org/10.1186/2047-217X-3-32){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer

        noopener\\\"}) introduced the Biodiversity Crisis with some\\ndizzying statistics.
        A study of 31,821 populations representing 5,230\\nspecies monitored across
        the globe showed a 69% decline in abundance.\\nThe decline is disproportionate
        across the globe with the megadiverse\\ncontinent of Africa showing a 66%
        reduction in biodiversity, and Latin\\nAmerica and the Caribbean showing a
        staggering 94% reduction in\\nbiodiversity. The message is clear -- we have
        to act now to conserve our\\nliving planet.\\n\\nConservation is a key focus
        of the GGBN, and this network -- coordinated\\nby the GGBN Secretariat hosted
        and supported by the National Museum of\\nNatural History, Smithsonian Institution,
        Washington, DC -- aims to\\nprovide the necessary Data Standards for BioBanked
        specimens in a global\\ncontext.\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image is-resized\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/UjgoqbzgJ_WcABy1q1hJW1PmZ73gnK-MJWkLvW7nKqusRmnNH_yXEP-7UeLp_Lv47_S0HH_mEe9jxAIa7Nq7hbD90mtFYc9nApbUc75GfAjtmE1BmVt-BCSCJdJCLLedfDtLVPExr2C4XrsR5H5NgCA\\\"\\ndecoding=\\\"async\\\"

        Biobanking for\\nConservation.*\\n\\nThe term 'Data Standards' is used to
        describe a set of terms and\\ncontrolled vocabularies designed to represent
        facts about a\\nsample/voucher. An additional important concept pertinent
        to the focus\\nof GGBN is the \\\"Digital Extended Specimen\\\", which is
        a cloud of\\ninformation around a vouchered specimen and which can include
        genomic\\nsequence data and metabolomics data.\\n\\n### **One Plan Approach**
        {#one-plan-approach .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nIn his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder
        highlighted the need for a common\\nstandard of good practice and information
        sharing. Towards this end,\\nOliver showcased the \\\"One Plan Approach\\\"
        which was formulated at the\\nIUCN World Conservation Congress 2020 at its
        session in Marseille,\\nFrance, and which \\\"urges the Secretariat and professional
        societies to\\npromote integration of *in situ* and *ex situ* conservation\\ninterventions\\\"
        and \\\"to ensure effective use of all available\\nconservation tools\\\".\\n\\nOf
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN\\nCommissions and
        Members to \\\"enable and support establishment of a global\\nnetwork of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species\\nconservation targets and
        operating to common standards of good practice\\nand information sharing.\\\"\\n\\n###
        **Genetic Rescue and Cloning** {#genetic-rescue-and-cloning .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nOliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost\\namongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue\\ninvolves an increase
        in fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated\\nindividuals into small,
        declining populations, and we have [explored\\nthis topic\\npreviously](http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"} with our publication of the genome of the\\ncritically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver\\nhighlighted how genetic rescue
        has been successful in [increasing the\\nfitness of the Florida\\npanther](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"} *Puma* *concolor coryi*, by moving female\\npanthers from Texas
        to Florida from the mid-1990s.\\n\\nMuch more technically challenging is the
        use of cloning to increase\\ngenetic fitness in endangered species. Oliver
        was swift to point out\\nthat this approach has been used for the critically
        endangered\\nPrzewalski's horse. The [first cloned *Equus\\nprzewalskii*](https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"} was foaled on August 6th 2020 and was named\\n'Kurt' in honour
        of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke of\\nSan Diego Zoo.\\n\\nIn
        the same year, a black-footed ferret named 'Elizabeth Ann' (born\\nDecember
        10, 2020) was [the first U.S. endangered species to be\\ncloned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"}. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen\\ncells from Willa,
        a black-footed female ferret who died in the 1980s and\\nwho had no living

        .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nA core focus of the GGBN conference was cryobanking
        of viable cells and\\ngametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking, **Jackie\\nMackenzie-Dodds**
        (Natural History Museum, London) referred to the\\ncryopreservation facilities
        as a \\\"treasure trove of molecules\\\". Jackie\\npointed out that viable
        cell lines are the most requested resource for\\nthe Natural History Museum
        BioBank, where they are used for the\\ngeneration of induced pluripotent stem
        cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.\\n\\nAnother important message from the GGBN
        conference was the need for Open\\nAccess BioBank facilities. Towards this
        end, an additional incentive for\\nresearchers and curators was provided by
        **Mudzuli Mavhunga** of\\nBiodiversity Biobanks South Africa (South African
        National Biodiversity\\nInstitute, Pretoria). Mudzuli highlighted that, if
        a South African\\nBioBank is awarded the status of Open Access, then it is
        eligible for\\nresource allocations through Biodiversity Biobanks South Africa
        (BBSA),\\nwhich is a great asset for a collection facility.\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        **Scalability of Cloning** {#scalability-of-cloning .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nSo
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? **Ben\\nNovak**
        of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk\\nentitled \\\"Important
        Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of\\nEndangered Species\\\",
        highlighted the example of passerines (perching\\nbirds) where programmed
        DNA loss is observed in some species. In\\npasserines such as the zebra finch
        (*Taeniopygia guttata*), there is a\\n[germ-line-restricted\\nchromosome](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"} -- known as an accessory chromosome -- that\\nis present in
        the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently [lost\\nduring male\\nmeiosis](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer

        is represented exclusively in the germ cells, and is\\nabsent from somatic
        cells of the [bone\\nmarrow](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer

        species,\\nand can occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of\\nchromosome
        regions and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes.\\nHowever, this
        phenomenon, if observed in somatic tissues, can severely\\nimpact on the ability

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \\\"which tissues\\nto

        line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is\\none means
        of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted\\nchromosomes in the cryopreservation
        of endangered species. The\\nalternative is to cryopreserve reproductive tissues.\\n\\n###
        **Cryopreservation for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues** {#cryopreservation-for-biobanking-of-gametes-and-reproductive-tissues
        .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nOn the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive
        tissues, invaluable\\ninsights were provided by **Tullis Matson** of [Nature's\\nSAFE](https://www.natures-safe.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"}, whose mission is to combat extinction by\\ncollecting, indefinitely
        storing and regenerating reproductive cells and\\ncell lines from endangered
        animal species.\\n\\nTullis has expertise in artificial insemination of rare
        equine breeds,\\nincluding the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for which
        there are\\nonly 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis\\nhas created Nature's SAFE with the intention of applying this know-how\\nof
        rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been on\\nfield
        trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An\\nimportant
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South\\nAfrica stay in
        South Africa, which is both an ethical and legal\\nobligation (see Sharing
        of Genomic Collections under the Nagoya Protocol\\nbelow).\\n\\nTullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal\\nsamples, and the role
        of Nature's SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian\\ntissue from the pied tamarin
        (*Saguinus bicolor*, critically\\nendangered), the lar gibbon (*Hylobates
        lar*, endangered), and the\\ncheetah (*Acinonyx jubatus*, vulnerable). As
        Tullis explained, \\\"working\\nwith leading reproductive scientists and cryobiologists,
        we use\\nstate-of-the-art methods to preserve cells in a way that maintains\\nviability,
        allowing them to be thawed and used to establish pregnancies,\\nrestoring
        endangered animal species\\\".\\n\\n### **From Fieldwork to BioBank** {#from-fieldwork-to-biobank

        which aims at sharing the benefits arising from\\nthe utilisation of genetic
        resources in a fair and equitable way. One of\\nthe key features of the Nagoya
        Protocol agreement is that a permit is\\nrequired for gathering a specimen.
        From a GGBN perspective, it is a\\nrequirement to share this information with
        GGBN, where it is stored in\\nthe Darwin Core metadata associated with a sample.\\n\\nAs
        an illustrative example, **Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago** (Universidad\\nAut\xF3noma
        de Aguascalientes) focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates\\nto Mexico
        and explained, \\\"you need to get a permit of collect\\\". One of\\nthe reasons
        for a permit is to ensure the recognition of the collective\\nproperty of
        indigenous lands, and to ensure that allegations of\\nbiopiracy are excluded
        from genomic collections. As Jocelyn explained,\\n\\\"the heart of the Nagoya
        protocol is community consent -- informed\\nconsent from indigenous people\\\".\\n\\n<figure

        went from 47% of the market in 2000 to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest

        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access
        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such
        policies. The whole system rests on this logic of extraction and that&#8217;s
        what needs to be opposed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"Today's

        found that it&#8217;s a struggle to get people&#8217;s interest and that we
        have to be creative in order to educate about OA issues. Part of what I suspect
        makes advocating for OA difficult is the sort of singularity that comes from
        being &#8220;just the library,&#8221; the group that&#8217;s always talking
        about it. So when this Open Science Working Group formed, I was excited about

        on open science</a> in 2022. Later they established the working group by inviting
        people to participate in a workshop (there were over 20 people representing
        many disciplines). The workshop operated through a modified form of DORA&#8217;s
        <a href=\\\"https://sfdora.org/resource/workshop-toolkit-to-introduce-the-space-rubric/\\\">SPACE

        to bolster open scholarship throughout the university. It addresses many issues,

        principles, open education, resources, and more. Of course, this is not the
        end of the process. Among other things, next steps include focused discussions
        with department heads, administrators, and others. I imagine that getting

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im\\nBereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen\\nbetont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und\\nFinanzierungsmodellen, die
        weder die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen\\nfinanziell belasten und sich
        durch angemessene und transparente Preise\\nauszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird
        beklagt, dass die steigenden Preise f\xFCr\\nwissenschaftliche Fachinformationen
        zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren und die\\n\xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil
        der Forschung belasten (Punkt\\n5).\\n\\nAufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen
        Verlagswesen wird in zwei\\nbemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung
        von nicht\\ngewinnorientierten Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:\\n\\n\\\"The
        Council of the European Union \\\\[...\\\\] highlights the importance of\\nnot-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not\\ncharge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their\\nwork without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the\\nvariety of models that do not depend on
        article processing charges or\\nsimilar per-unit charges and stresses the
        importance of supporting the\\ndevelopment of such models led by public research
        organisations; \\\\[...\\\\]\\nstresses that it is essential to avoid situations
        where researchers are\\nlimited in their choice of publication channels due
        to financial\\ncapacities rather than quality criteria, and where access to
        research\\npublications is restricted by paywalls\\\"\\n\\nZwar sind diese
        Unterstreichung und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner\\nSchritt auf dem
        Weg zur Gestaltung eines pluralistischen, transparenten\\nund nachhaltigen
        Systems der digtialen Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie\\nkommen jedoch zu einem
        Zeitpunkt, zu dem die Kritik an dem Modell der\\nPublikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.\\n\\nErst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den\\nUSA,
        als Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker\\nEinrichtungen, das
        APC-Modell [deutlich\\nkritisiert](https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/).\\nDie
        Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren\\nUngleichheit
        f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut\\nausgestatteten Regionen
        beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt\\nwerden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.\\n\\nAuch hat der \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame\\n[R\xFCcktritt](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5)
        des\\nEditorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender\\nAPCs
        den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die\\nzur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues\\nJournal\\n[gegr\xFCndet](https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/),\\ndas
        niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das\\nProblem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.\\n\\nUm die im obrigen
        Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu\\nadressieren, soll die Koordinierung
        innerhalb der EU und mit globalen\\nPartnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung von Chancengleichheit
        im wissenschaftlichen\\nPublizieren gef\xF6rdert werden (Absatz 7). Hierzu
        sollen auch abgestimmte\\nFinanzierungsstrategien entwickelt werden, um die
        Anzahl von\\nnot-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly publishing
        models in\\nEurope with no costs for authors or readers\\\" signifikant zu
        erh\xF6hen\\n(Absatz 11).\\n\\nAuch soll das Anliegen durch eine m\xF6gliche
        Beteiligung der\\nEU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe (ORE), der von
        der\\nEU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr Autor:innen
        aus den\\nEU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).\_\\n\\nIn

        weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen\\naugegriffen:\_\\n\\n\\\"Some
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into\\ntheir national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly\\npublications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national\\nopen access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications\\nimmediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions\\nacknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like\\nwithin the framework of the European
        Open Science Cloud (EOSC), and\\nsuggest including open science monitoring

        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des\\nwissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens

        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf\\ninternationaler

        you may have seen in the <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/22/personal-data-stolen-in-british-library-cyber-attack-appears-for-sale-online\\\">news</a>,
        the British Library has been affected by a significant cyberattack. Many of
        the digital services it provides have gone down and stayed down for many weeks
        now, whilst investigations take place. I have a lot of sympathy for the BL
        staff. As has been <a href=\\\"https://hcommons.social/@mia/111483661298025928\\\">observed</a>,
        public services can be a relatively easy target.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Two of
        the very wide variety of digital services that the BL provide, that I have
        a particular interest in are:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>a) the ISSN National Centre
        for the UK: <a href=\\\"https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html\\\">https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html</a><br>b)
        the E-Theses Online Service (EThOS): <a href=\\\"http://ethos.bl.uk/\\\">http://ethos.bl.uk/</a>
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Both of these services, and many others (do we even know
        how many?) are still offline at the time of writing this (2023-11-30). I can
        probably live without registering a new ISSN, that can wait. But what about
        access to my PhD thesis? I want people to be able to read this. Is it still
        available online anywhere? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>My thesis EThOS ID is: uk.bl.ethos.64202
        . In more normal times it would be publicly available via this link: <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022\\\">https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022</a>
        <br><br>Fortunately, because I retained my rights to it, my thesis is openly-licensed
        under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 licence, and copies of it can be
        uploaded wherever I want. As a consequence, my thesis is also available from
        the <a href=\\\"https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/comparative-cladistics-fossils-morphological-data-partitions-and-\\\">University

        Archive</a>. Even if one or two of these repositories goes down, it&#8217;s
        highly likely that my thesis will always be accessible from somewhere on the
        internet 24/7, no matter what. Posting content in multiple independently-run
        places gives others access to that content in a highly <em>resilient</em>
        way. It is also worth mentioning, there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0165551510389358\\\">study</a>
        suggesting that OA content made available in multiple places gets cited more
        than OA content only available in one place.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        got me thinking again about the major &#8216;Atyponocalypse&#8217; downtime
        event of 17th December 2020. Do you remember it? I certainly do (the screenshot
        above is from that event). The journal hosting platforms of SAGE, ACS Publications,
        Wiley, Taylor &amp; Francis and many others all simultaneously went offline
        for roughly a 24 hour period because of an error at <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon\\\">Atypon</a>,
        the publishing platform that many different legacy publishers use. It was
        unprecedented. People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of important
        knowledge were made almost completely digitally unavailable, worldwide. I
        like how <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185\\\">Brie</a>
        put it, at the time:<br><br>&#8220;One day left for student finals and Wiley&#8217;s
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites are all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and consolidations of academic knowledge again?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click\\\">#WileyDown</a>&#8221;
        (and that was the numbers for just <em>one</em> publisher)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        interesting thing about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for much of
        the content affected, there was no alternative, legal platform hosting the
        content in parallel.  Nor could people put online temporary copies to help
        students and researchers access the content they urgently needed &#8211; because
        of the copyright restrictions on that content. Many of the legacy publishers,
        for their paywalled journals (only), still have this major single-point-of-failure
        weakness.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But open access content does NOT suffer these
        weaknesses.<br><br>As I allude to in the title of this post. The key differentiators
        here in open access systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime
        overall are a) availability on multiple independent platforms and b) open
        licencing that makes it legally easier to host content in multiple places.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tools
        such as Google Scholar, <a href=\\\"https://openalex.org/\\\">OpenAlex</a>,
        and <a href=\\\"https://www.base-search.net/\\\">BASE</a> can signpost the
        way to where these alternative copies live. Research can stay openly accessible
        24/7, 365 days a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed and thus easy
        to host on multiple platforms.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Even if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g. <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/\\\">Michigan</a>
        recently) experience some downtime through cyberattacks or &#8216;unplanned
        maintainence&#8217;, the global collective network of repositories can ensure
        that the scholarship remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different locations.
        \ <strong>The next time you see a paywalled journal experiencing some significant
        downtime, please let me know.</strong> I think there are some very interesting
        natural obervation experiments that could be done around these events to tease
        out the differences in impact between open-licensed and &#8216;all rights
        reserved&#8217; content.  Does anyone maintain a wiki or database of major
        downtime events at academic publishers? There have been quite a few already&#8230;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        I want people to be able to read this. Is it\\nstill available online anywhere?\\n\\nMy

        the major 'Atyponocalypse' downtime\\nevent of 17th December 2020. Do you
        remember it? I certainly do (the\\nscreenshot above is from that event). The
        journal hosting platforms of\\nSAGE, ACS Publications, Wiley, Taylor & Francis
        and many others all\\nsimultaneously went offline for roughly a 24 hour period
        because of an\\nerror at [Atypon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon), the
        publishing\\nplatform that many different legacy publishers use. It was\\nunprecedented.
        People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of\\nimportant knowledge
        were made almost completely digitally unavailable,\\nworldwide. I like how\\n[Brie](https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185)
        put\\nit, at the time:  \\n  \\n\\\"One day left for student finals and Wiley's
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites\\nare all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and\\nconsolidations of academic knowledge again?\\\"  \\n  \\n\\\"1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with\\n[\\\\#WileyDown](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click)\\\"\\n(and
        that was the numbers for just *one* publisher)\\n\\nThe interesting thing
        about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for\\nmuch of the content affected,
        there was no alternative, legal platform\\nhosting the content in parallel.
        Nor could people put online temporary\\ncopies to help students and researchers
        access the content they urgently\\nneeded -- because of the copyright restrictions
        on that content. Many of\\nthe legacy publishers, for their paywalled journals
        (only), still have\\nthis major single-point-of-failure weakness.\\n\\nBut
        open access content does NOT suffer these weaknesses.  \\n  \\nAs I allude
        to in the title of this post. The key differentiators here\\nin open access
        systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime\\noverall are a)
        availability on multiple independent platforms and b)\\nopen licencing that
        makes it legally easier to host content in multiple\\nplaces.\\n\\nTools such
        as Google Scholar, [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/), and\\n[BASE](https://www.base-search.net/)
        can signpost the way to where these\\nalternative copies live. Research can
        stay openly accessible 24/7, 365\\ndays a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed
        and thus easy to host\\non multiple platforms.\\n\\nEven if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g.\\n[Michigan](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/)\\nrecently)
        experience some downtime through cyberattacks or 'unplanned\\nmaintainence',
        the global collective network of repositories can ensure\\nthat the scholarship
        remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different\\nlocations. **The next time
        you see a paywalled journal experiencing some\\nsignificant downtime, please
        let me know.** I think there are some very\\ninteresting natural obervation
        experiments that could be done around\\nthese events to tease out the differences
        in impact between\\nopen-licensed and 'all rights reserved' content. Does
        anyone maintain a\\nwiki or database of major downtime events at academic
        publishers? There\\nhave been quite a few already...\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        has been enriched with numerous new indexes of open citation data from different
        sources. However, the quantity and diversification of the ingested information
        have raised several issues, which recently made it essential to conduct a
        complete revision of the ingestion workflow. The result was a revolution in
        the way OpenCitations data is delivered. In this blog post, we will explain
        the context and challenges raised by the old procedure. Then, we will present
        the new ingestion workflow, designed to produce </span><b>just two comprehensive
        collections</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">:</span><b> OpenCitations
        Index</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">, collecting open citation data,
        and </span><b>OpenCitations Meta</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">,
        for the open bibliographical metadata.\_</span></p>\\r\\n<h4 style=\\\"text-align:

        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">In
        2018, OpenCitations released the kickoff version of its first citation index,
        </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/961\\\"><b>COCI </b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">(citations from Crossref)</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">, which contained around 300 million citation links derived from the
        subset of the reference lists in the Crossref database, where citing and cited
        entities were identified using Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). COCI gathered
        citations with associated metadata in compliance with the recommendations
        from the Initiative for Open Citations (</span><a href=\\\"https://i4oc.org/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">I4OC</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">) that citation data should be structured, separable, and open, thus
        marking a turning point by providing a disruptive and free and open alternative
        to earlier sources such as Google Scholar, which provided freely accessible
        data although not downloadable, and Web of Science or Scopus, which demanded
        paid access.\_</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">In a short time, COCI became a competitive
        and trusted index of citation data, used by numerous institutional repositories,
        including </span><a href=\\\"https://service.tib.eu/bison/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight:

        400\\\">Optimeta</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">. In 2021,
        COCI was taken into account </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/1420\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">in a comparative study</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\"> with the most relevant sources in the landscape, including the proprietary
        ones, which showed its coverage approaching parity with those of the other
        sources involved in the analysis (Microsoft Academic, Scopus, Dimensions,
        and Web of Science). At the time of its most recent update in January 2023,
        COCI counted more than 1.4 billion citations. The reason behind this outstanding
        number lies in several factors, including </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/1165\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">Elsevier\u2019s endorsement of the Declaration
        on Research Assessment (DORA) in December 2020</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">, leading to the open release via Crossref of the reference lists
        of the articles published in all its journals, and confirming the value of
        initiatives such as the </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/696\\\"><span

        justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">However, before this change
        of heart, in 2019 OpenCitations had tried to narrow the open citations coverage
        gap by launching its second index, the </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/944\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">Crowdsourced Open Citations Index (</span><b>CROCI</b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">)</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">.
        This index allowed publishers and scholars to contribute directly by uploading
        crowdsourced open citations into the OpenCitations infrastructure.</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">In
        December 2022, a new concrete step towards a factual plurality of OpenCitations
        indexes was taken by the ingestion of new data sources into the infrastructure,
        with the publication of the inaugural dumps of </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/3106\\\"><b>DOCI

        of five collections from different sources.\_</span></p>\\r\\n<h4 style=\\\"text-align:

        and new challenges</b></h4>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">While having such a variety and richness of
        indexes helped present the extent of OpenCitations sources, the recent </span><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">increment in the number of sources and the
        diversification of data integrated led to two primary </span><b>issues</b><span

        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">Moreover,
        it soon became evident the need to optimize the reuse of the already developed
        software components </span><b>to facilitate the metadata crosswalk processes
        between the new sources\u2019 data models and the OpenCitations Data Model</b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">, with </span><b>the aim to define a functional
        and easily extendable workflow</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\"> to
        be easily reused when it comes to incorporating new data sources, which should

        enough to capture the necessary information within each of the specific data
        models and formats.\_</span></li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">As
        a solution, we decided to use </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/3140\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">OpenCitations Meta</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">, the new OpenCitations database and tool for managing bibliographic
        data related to the publications involved in the citations. OpenCitations
        Meta makes it possible to assign each entity involved in a citation an internal
        identifier, nominally the OpenCitations Meta Identifier (OMID), to which all
        the associated persistent identifiers of the same publication are redirected.</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">As
        a result, the allocation of an OMID for each bibliographic resource also enabled
        the unambiguous identification of each citation, regardless of the persistent
        identifier schema originally used by the data source to identify the resources.
        This approach allowed us to perform data deduplication and finally make all
        the sources\u2019 contributions converge into </span><b>a unified index containing
        all the unique citations managed by OpenCitations, expressed as OMID to OMID
        citation links.</b></p>\\r\\n<h4 style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><b>The
        revised workflow</b></h4>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">The new workflow is based on </span><b>three
        main components</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\"> with the </span><b>benefit
        </b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">of optimizing the process both in
        terms of computational cost and in terms of flexibility. As shown in Fig.
        1, in a preliminary step, source-specific software converts the input dataset
        &#8211; structured according to the source data model &#8211; to extract two
        OpenCitations Data Model compliant data collections in tabular format for
        bibliographic metadata and citation data, respectively.</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">The
        following steps are common to the process of each dataset.\_\_</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><b>STEP 1</b><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">: The bibliographic metadata collection is used as input for the META
        software. At this stage, it is checked whether or not the bibliographic entities
        have been previously integrated into our infrastructure (coming from other
        data sources). If so, the existing OMID is linked also to the new alternative
        identifiers of the new bibliographic resources. New metadata values, if any,
        are also integrated. A new OMID identifier is produced for entities never
        previously encountered, uniquely representing the bibliographic resource in
        OpenCitations. The outputs of the process are: (I) an updated version of the
        OpenCitations Meta collection that also includes the metadata of the bibliographic
        entities provided by the new source, and (II) a collection of provenance data.
        An internal database is constantly refreshed to preserve correspondence between
        IDs and the associated internal OMIDs.</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:
        justify\\\"><b>STEP 2</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">: Starting from
        the collection of citations expressed as directional links between identifiers
        of potentially any type (e.g., DOI-DOI, PMID-PMID, PMC-PMID, etc.), the INDEX
        software queries the internal database mapping IDs to OMIDs to produce an
        updated version of the OpenCitations Index: unique citations expressed as
        OMID-OMID links in different formats, accompanied by their corresponding provenance
        data.</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\"

        to the new alternative identifiers of the new\\nbibliographic resources. New
        metadata values, if any, are also\\nintegrated. A new OMID identifier is produced
        for entities never\\npreviously encountered, uniquely representing the bibliographic
        resource\\nin OpenCitations. The outputs of the process are: (I) an updated

        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing

        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        there was clear focus on BioBanking at the GGBN conference, I was additionally

        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.

        A study of 31,821 populations representing 5,230\\nspecies monitored across
        the globe showed a 69% decline in abundance.\\nThe decline is disproportionate
        across the globe with the megadiverse\\ncontinent of Africa showing a 66%
        reduction in biodiversity, and Latin\\nAmerica and the Caribbean showing a
        staggering 94% reduction in\\nbiodiversity. The message is clear -- we have
        to act now to conserve our\\nliving planet.\\n\\nConservation is a key focus
        of the GGBN, and this network -- coordinated\\nby the GGBN Secretariat hosted

        facts about a\\nsample/voucher. An additional important concept pertinent
        to the focus\\nof GGBN is the \\\"Digital Extended Specimen\\\", which is
        a cloud of\\ninformation around a vouchered specimen and which can include
        genomic\\nsequence data and metabolomics data.\\n\\n### **One Plan Approach**
        {#one-plan-approach .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nIn his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder
        highlighted the need for a common\\nstandard of good practice and information
        sharing. Towards this end,\\nOliver showcased the \\\"One Plan Approach\\\"
        which was formulated at the\\nIUCN World Conservation Congress 2020 at its
        session in Marseille,\\nFrance, and which \\\"urges the Secretariat and professional
        societies to\\npromote integration of *in situ* and *ex situ* conservation\\ninterventions\\\"
        and \\\"to ensure effective use of all available\\nconservation tools\\\".\\n\\nOf
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN\\nCommissions and
        Members to \\\"enable and support establishment of a global\\nnetwork of biobanks

        operating to common standards of good practice\\nand information sharing.\\\"\\n\\n###
        **Genetic Rescue and Cloning** {#genetic-rescue-and-cloning .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nOliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost\\namongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue\\ninvolves an increase
        in fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated\\nindividuals into small,
        declining populations, and we have [explored\\nthis topic\\npreviously](http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"} with our publication of the genome of the\\ncritically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver\\nhighlighted how genetic rescue
        has been successful in [increasing the\\nfitness of the Florida\\npanther](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"} *Puma* *concolor coryi*, by moving female\\npanthers from Texas
        to Florida from the mid-1990s.\\n\\nMuch more technically challenging is the
        use of cloning to increase\\ngenetic fitness in endangered species. Oliver
        was swift to point out\\nthat this approach has been used for the critically
        endangered\\nPrzewalski's horse. The [first cloned *Equus\\nprzewalskii*](https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer

        resources in a fair and equitable way. One of\\nthe key features of the Nagoya
        Protocol agreement is that a permit is\\nrequired for gathering a specimen.
        From a GGBN perspective, it is a\\nrequirement to share this information with

        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access
        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such
        policies. The whole system rests on this logic of extraction and that&#8217;s

        concepts, which makes the whole prospect of institutional change quite complex.
        I&#8217;m very excited about the efforts so far that the Open Science Working
        Group (of which I&#8217;m a participant) at Concordia University has undertaken
        and accomplished. These include an initial report on &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.11573/spectrum.library.concordia.ca.00992647\\\"><strong>Recommendations

        course, the Library is always doing outreach about open access (OA). In the
        past I&#8217;ve organized activities, events, and <a href=\\\"https://chroknowlogy.ca/intellectual-liberty/2022/talk-broad-value-open-access/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"post\\\" data-id=\\\"64563\\\">projects</a> for <a href=\\\"https://www.openaccessweek.org/\\\">open
        access week</a>. I can see how frequently our modern research practices, which
        involve digital techniques are enabled by the various forms of open: open
        source, open data, open protocols, open access, etc. However, I&#8217;ve always
        found that it&#8217;s a struggle to get people&#8217;s interest and that we
        have to be creative in order to educate about OA issues. Part of what I suspect
        makes advocating for OA difficult is the sort of singularity that comes from
        being &#8220;just the library,&#8221; the group that&#8217;s always talking
        about it. So when this Open Science Working Group formed, I was excited about
        its multidisciplinary nature and that it included both students and faculty.
        I think that really helps to broaden involvement across the university.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        working group, led by colleagues Krista Byers-Heinlein (who is also Concordia
        University Research Chair in Bilingualism and Open Science) and Nicol\xE1s
        Alessandroni, initiated the effort through a day-long <a href=\\\"https://www.concordia.ca/cuevents/artsci/2022/05/27/open-science-concordia.html\\\">conference
        on open science</a> in 2022. Later they established the working group by inviting
        people to participate in a workshop (there were over 20 people representing
        many disciplines). The workshop operated through a modified form of DORA&#8217;s
        <a href=\\\"https://sfdora.org/resource/workshop-toolkit-to-introduce-the-space-rubric/\\\">SPACE
        rubric</a>, which was designed for academic institutions to use toward improving
        their policies. I think using that tool to organize such a large group of
        people toward a practical outcome was extremely beneficial. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        more meetings, discussions, and revisions the working group was able to produce
        a set of <a href=\\\"https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/id/eprint/992647/\\\">recommendations</a>
        to bolster open scholarship throughout the university. It addresses many issues,
        including existing policies, outreach, inter-institutional work, position
        principles, open education, resources, and more. Of course, this is not the
        end of the process. Among other things, next steps include focused discussions
        with department heads, administrators, and others. I imagine that getting
        to a place where open scholarship/open science is well-understood and hopefully
        a default institutional position for research and education will require ongoing
        work. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The recommendations in the report tend to be specific
        within the context of Concordia University but I felt it worthwhile to write
        about here because the process, the findings, and the recommendations may
        be of interest to others. Perhaps you would like to try something similar
        at your institution? The Concordia work could be one model to reflect on what
        would work well or not so well in your own context.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"The

        Open Science at Concordia\\nUniversity**](https://doi.org/10.11573/spectrum.library.concordia.ca.00992647)\\\"\\n(DOI:
        10.11573/spectrum.library.concordia.ca.00992647)\\n\\nOf course, the Library
        is always doing outreach about open access (OA).\\nIn the past I've organized
        activities, events, and\\n[projects](https://chroknowlogy.ca/intellectual-liberty/2022/talk-broad-value-open-access/){data-type=\\\"post\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"64563\\\"}
        for [open access\\nweek](https://www.openaccessweek.org/). I can see how frequently
        our\\nmodern research practices, which involve digital techniques are enabled\\nby
        the various forms of open: open source, open data, open protocols,\\nopen
        access, etc. However, I've always found that it's a struggle to get\\npeople's
        interest and that we have to be creative in order to educate\\nabout OA issues.
        Part of what I suspect makes advocating for OA\\ndifficult is the sort of
        singularity that comes from being \\\"just the\\nlibrary,\\\" the group that's
        always talking about it. So when this Open\\nScience Working Group formed,
        I was excited about its multidisciplinary\\nnature and that it included both
        students and faculty. I think that\\nreally helps to broaden involvement across
        the university.\\n\\nThe working group, led by colleagues Krista Byers-Heinlein
        (who is also\\nConcordia University Research Chair in Bilingualism and Open
        Science)\\nand Nicol\xE1s Alessandroni, initiated the effort through a day-long\\n[conference
        on open\\nscience](https://www.concordia.ca/cuevents/artsci/2022/05/27/open-science-concordia.html)\\nin
        2022. Later they established the working group by inviting people to\\nparticipate
        in a workshop (there were over 20 people representing many\\ndisciplines).
        The workshop operated through a modified form of DORA's\\n[SPACE\\nrubric](https://sfdora.org/resource/workshop-toolkit-to-introduce-the-space-rubric/),\\nwhich
        was designed for academic institutions to use toward improving\\ntheir policies.
        I think using that tool to organize such a large group\\nof people toward
        a practical outcome was extremely beneficial.\\n\\nAfter more meetings, discussions,
        and revisions the working group was\\nable to produce a set of\\n[recommendations](https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/id/eprint/992647/)\\nto
        bolster open scholarship throughout the university. It addresses many\\nissues,
        including existing policies, outreach, inter-institutional work,\\nposition
        principles, open education, resources, and more. Of course,\\nthis is not
        the end of the process. Among other things, next steps\\ninclude focused discussions
        with department heads, administrators, and\\nothers. I imagine that getting
        to a place where open scholarship/open\\nscience is well-understood and hopefully
        a default institutional\\nposition for research and education will require
        ongoing work.\\n\\nThe recommendations in the report tend to be specific within
        the context\\nof Concordia University but I felt it worthwhile to write about
        here\\nbecause the process, the findings, and the recommendations may be of\\ninterest
        to others. Perhaps you would like to try something similar at\\nyour institution?
        The Concordia work could be one model to reflect on\\nwhat would work well
        or not so well in your own context.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/pk905-p9r05\",\"guid\":\"https://chroknowlogy.ca/?p=64616\",\"id\":\"b11b28bb-f44a-4dc7-a3ea-3917c603e3ef\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1692993161,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"The

        [Times Higher\\nEducation](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/can-eu-make-parallel-publishing-system-work)).\\nIm

        und Gesch\xE4ftsmodelle abseits von Publikationsgeb\xFChren\\n(Article Processing
        Charges, APCs) legt und ob sogar eine Abkehr von der\\nUnterst\xFCtzung dieses
        Modells durch die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa betont\\nwird.\\n\\nSchweden
        hatte das Thema im Rahmen seiner EU-Ratspr\xE4sidentschaft\\naugegriffen und
        bereits im\\n[Februar](https://wisspub.net/2023/02/10/eu-wissenschaftsministerien-erortern-open-science/)\\nin
        einem Hintergrund-Papier adressiert. Schon in diesem Briefing Paper\\nwurde

        den EU-Wissenschaftsministerien erhoben. Die\\nWissenschaftsminister:innen
        hatten damals einen Open-Access-Anteil von\\n100 % bis 2020 gefordert. Dieser
        Wert wurde bisher jedoch nicht\\nerreicht. In Deutschland liegt der Open-Access-Anteil

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im\\nBereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen\\nbetont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und\\nFinanzierungsmodellen, die
        weder die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen\\nfinanziell belasten und sich
        durch angemessene und transparente Preise\\nauszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird
        beklagt, dass die steigenden Preise f\xFCr\\nwissenschaftliche Fachinformationen
        zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren und die\\n\xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil
        der Forschung belasten (Punkt\\n5).\\n\\nAufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen
        Verlagswesen wird in zwei\\nbemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung
        von nicht\\ngewinnorientierten Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:\\n\\n\\\"The
        Council of the European Union \\\\[...\\\\] highlights the importance of\\nnot-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not\\ncharge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their\\nwork without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the\\nvariety of models that do not depend on
        article processing charges or\\nsimilar per-unit charges and stresses the
        importance of supporting the\\ndevelopment of such models led by public research
        organisations; \\\\[...\\\\]\\nstresses that it is essential to avoid situations
        where researchers are\\nlimited in their choice of publication channels due
        to financial\\ncapacities rather than quality criteria, and where access to
        research\\npublications is restricted by paywalls\\\"\\n\\nZwar sind diese
        Unterstreichung und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner\\nSchritt auf dem
        Weg zur Gestaltung eines pluralistischen, transparenten\\nund nachhaltigen
        Systems der digtialen Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie\\nkommen jedoch zu einem
        Zeitpunkt, zu dem die Kritik an dem Modell der\\nPublikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.\\n\\nErst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den\\nUSA,
        als Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker\\nEinrichtungen, das
        APC-Modell [deutlich\\nkritisiert](https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/).\\nDie
        Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren\\nUngleichheit
        f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut\\nausgestatteten Regionen
        beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt\\nwerden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.\\n\\nAuch hat der \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame\\n[R\xFCcktritt](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5)
        des\\nEditorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender\\nAPCs
        den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die\\nzur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues\\nJournal\\n[gegr\xFCndet](https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/),\\ndas
        niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das\\nProblem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.\\n\\nUm die im obrigen
        Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu\\nadressieren, soll die Koordinierung
        innerhalb der EU und mit globalen\\nPartnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung von Chancengleichheit
        im wissenschaftlichen\\nPublizieren gef\xF6rdert werden (Absatz 7). Hierzu
        sollen auch abgestimmte\\nFinanzierungsstrategien entwickelt werden, um die
        Anzahl von\\nnot-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly publishing
        models in\\nEurope with no costs for authors or readers\\\" signifikant zu
        erh\xF6hen\\n(Absatz 11).\\n\\nAuch soll das Anliegen durch eine m\xF6gliche
        Beteiligung der\\nEU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe (ORE), der von
        der\\nEU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr Autor:innen
        aus den\\nEU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).\_\\n\\nIn
        der\\n[Pressemitteilung](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/)\\nwerden
        weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen\\naugegriffen:\_\\n\\n\\\"Some
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into\\ntheir national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly\\npublications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national\\nopen access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications\\nimmediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions\\nacknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like\\nwithin the framework of the European
        Open Science Cloud (EOSC), and\\nsuggest including open science monitoring
        in the European Research Area\\nmonitoring mechanism.\\\"\\n\\nDie Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des\\nwissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer\\nTr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu\\nbegr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote\\nund
        -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder\\ngemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig\\nzu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf\\ninternationaler

        you may have seen in the <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/22/personal-data-stolen-in-british-library-cyber-attack-appears-for-sale-online\\\">news</a>,
        the British Library has been affected by a significant cyberattack. Many of
        the digital services it provides have gone down and stayed down for many weeks
        now, whilst investigations take place. I have a lot of sympathy for the BL
        staff. As has been <a href=\\\"https://hcommons.social/@mia/111483661298025928\\\">observed</a>,
        public services can be a relatively easy target.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Two of
        the very wide variety of digital services that the BL provide, that I have
        a particular interest in are:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>a) the ISSN National Centre
        for the UK: <a href=\\\"https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html\\\">https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html</a><br>b)
        the E-Theses Online Service (EThOS): <a href=\\\"http://ethos.bl.uk/\\\">http://ethos.bl.uk/</a>
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Both of these services, and many others (do we even know
        how many?) are still offline at the time of writing this (2023-11-30). I can
        probably live without registering a new ISSN, that can wait. But what about
        access to my PhD thesis? I want people to be able to read this. Is it still
        available online anywhere? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>My thesis EThOS ID is: uk.bl.ethos.64202
        . In more normal times it would be publicly available via this link: <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022\\\">https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022</a>
        <br><br>Fortunately, because I retained my rights to it, my thesis is openly-licensed
        under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 licence, and copies of it can be
        uploaded wherever I want. As a consequence, my thesis is also available from
        the <a href=\\\"https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/comparative-cladistics-fossils-morphological-data-partitions-and-\\\">University

        Archive</a>. Even if one or two of these repositories goes down, it&#8217;s
        highly likely that my thesis will always be accessible from somewhere on the
        internet 24/7, no matter what. Posting content in multiple independently-run
        places gives others access to that content in a highly <em>resilient</em>
        way. It is also worth mentioning, there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0165551510389358\\\">study</a>
        suggesting that OA content made available in multiple places gets cited more
        than OA content only available in one place.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        got me thinking again about the major &#8216;Atyponocalypse&#8217; downtime
        event of 17th December 2020. Do you remember it? I certainly do (the screenshot
        above is from that event). The journal hosting platforms of SAGE, ACS Publications,
        Wiley, Taylor &amp; Francis and many others all simultaneously went offline
        for roughly a 24 hour period because of an error at <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon\\\">Atypon</a>,
        the publishing platform that many different legacy publishers use. It was
        unprecedented. People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of important
        knowledge were made almost completely digitally unavailable, worldwide. I
        like how <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185\\\">Brie</a>
        put it, at the time:<br><br>&#8220;One day left for student finals and Wiley&#8217;s
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites are all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and consolidations of academic knowledge again?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click\\\">#WileyDown</a>&#8221;
        (and that was the numbers for just <em>one</em> publisher)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        interesting thing about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for much of
        the content affected, there was no alternative, legal platform hosting the
        content in parallel.  Nor could people put online temporary copies to help
        students and researchers access the content they urgently needed &#8211; because
        of the copyright restrictions on that content. Many of the legacy publishers,
        for their paywalled journals (only), still have this major single-point-of-failure
        weakness.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But open access content does NOT suffer these
        weaknesses.<br><br>As I allude to in the title of this post. The key differentiators
        here in open access systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime
        overall are a) availability on multiple independent platforms and b) open
        licencing that makes it legally easier to host content in multiple places.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tools
        such as Google Scholar, <a href=\\\"https://openalex.org/\\\">OpenAlex</a>,
        and <a href=\\\"https://www.base-search.net/\\\">BASE</a> can signpost the
        way to where these alternative copies live. Research can stay openly accessible
        24/7, 365 days a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed and thus easy
        to host on multiple platforms.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Even if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g. <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/\\\">Michigan</a>
        recently) experience some downtime through cyberattacks or &#8216;unplanned
        maintainence&#8217;, the global collective network of repositories can ensure
        that the scholarship remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different locations.
        \ <strong>The next time you see a paywalled journal experiencing some significant
        downtime, please let me know.</strong> I think there are some very interesting
        natural obervation experiments that could be done around these events to tease
        out the differences in impact between open-licensed and &#8216;all rights
        reserved&#8217; content.  Does anyone maintain a wiki or database of major
        downtime events at academic publishers? There have been quite a few already&#8230;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        has been enriched with numerous new indexes of open citation data from different

        have raised several issues, which recently made it essential to conduct a

        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">In
        2018, OpenCitations released the kickoff version of its first citation index,
        </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/961\\\"><b>COCI </b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">(citations from Crossref)</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:

        subset of the reference lists in the Crossref database, where citing and cited
        entities were identified using Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). COCI gathered
        citations with associated metadata in compliance with the recommendations
        from the Initiative for Open Citations (</span><a href=\\\"https://i4oc.org/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">I4OC</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">) that citation data should be structured, separable, and open, thus
        marking a turning point by providing a disruptive and free and open alternative
        to earlier sources such as Google Scholar, which provided freely accessible
        data although not downloadable, and Web of Science or Scopus, which demanded
        paid access.\_</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">In a short time, COCI became a competitive
        and trusted index of citation data, used by numerous institutional repositories,
        including </span><a href=\\\"https://service.tib.eu/bison/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight:

        COCI was taken into account </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/1420\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">in a comparative study</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\"> with the most relevant sources in the landscape, including the proprietary
        ones, which showed its coverage approaching parity with those of the other
        sources involved in the analysis (Microsoft Academic, Scopus, Dimensions,
        and Web of Science). At the time of its most recent update in January 2023,
        COCI counted more than 1.4 billion citations. The reason behind this outstanding
        number lies in several factors, including </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/1165\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">Elsevier\u2019s endorsement of the Declaration
        on Research Assessment (DORA) in December 2020</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">, leading to the open release via Crossref of the reference lists
        of the articles published in all its journals, and confirming the value of
        initiatives such as the </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/696\\\"><span

        justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">However, before this change
        of heart, in 2019 OpenCitations had tried to narrow the open citations coverage
        gap by launching its second index, the </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/944\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">Crowdsourced Open Citations Index (</span><b>CROCI</b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">)</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">.
        This index allowed publishers and scholars to contribute directly by uploading
        crowdsourced open citations into the OpenCitations infrastructure.</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">In
        December 2022, a new concrete step towards a factual plurality of OpenCitations
        indexes was taken by the ingestion of new data sources into the infrastructure,
        with the publication of the inaugural dumps of </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/3106\\\"><b>DOCI

        of five collections from different sources.\_</span></p>\\r\\n<h4 style=\\\"text-align:
        justify\\\"><b>Why a new workflow? The issues with multiple sources management
        and new challenges</b></h4>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">While having such a variety and richness of
        indexes helped present the extent of OpenCitations sources, the recent </span><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">increment in the number of sources and the
        diversification of data integrated led to two primary </span><b>issues</b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">: </span></p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n<li style=\\\"list-style-type:
        none\\\">\\r\\n<ol style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\">\\r\\n<li>the necessity
        to handle the ingestion of new identifier types in a DOI-based software infrastructure,
        and</li>\\r\\n<li>the consequent possibility of encountering the same citation
        expressed by several sources with different identifiers.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">Moreover,
        it soon became evident the need to optimize the reuse of the already developed
        software components </span><b>to facilitate the metadata crosswalk processes
        between the new sources\u2019 data models and the OpenCitations Data Model</b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">, with </span><b>the aim to define a functional
        and easily extendable workflow</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\"> to
        be easily reused when it comes to incorporating new data sources, which should
        be:\_</span></p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n<li style=\\\"list-style-type: none\\\">\\r\\n<ol
        style=\\\"list-style-type: lower-alpha;text-align: justify\\\">\\r\\n<li><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">sufficiently generic to establish a globally
        unique procedure;\_</span></li>\\r\\n<li><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">customizable
        enough to capture the necessary information within each of the specific data
        models and formats.\_</span></li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">As
        a solution, we decided to use </span><a href=\\\"https://opencitations.hypotheses.org/3140\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">OpenCitations Meta</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">, the new OpenCitations database and tool for managing bibliographic
        data related to the publications involved in the citations. OpenCitations
        Meta makes it possible to assign each entity involved in a citation an internal
        identifier, nominally the OpenCitations Meta Identifier (OMID), to which all
        the associated persistent identifiers of the same publication are redirected.</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">As
        a result, the allocation of an OMID for each bibliographic resource also enabled
        the unambiguous identification of each citation, regardless of the persistent
        identifier schema originally used by the data source to identify the resources.
        This approach allowed us to perform data deduplication and finally make all
        the sources\u2019 contributions converge into </span><b>a unified index containing
        all the unique citations managed by OpenCitations, expressed as OMID to OMID
        citation links.</b></p>\\r\\n<h4 style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><b>The
        revised workflow</b></h4>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">The new workflow is based on </span><b>three
        main components</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\"> with the </span><b>benefit
        </b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">of optimizing the process both in
        terms of computational cost and in terms of flexibility. As shown in Fig.
        1, in a preliminary step, source-specific software converts the input dataset
        &#8211; structured according to the source data model &#8211; to extract two
        OpenCitations Data Model compliant data collections in tabular format for
        bibliographic metadata and citation data, respectively.</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">The
        following steps are common to the process of each dataset.\_\_</span></p>\\r\\n<p
        style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><b>STEP 1</b><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400\\\">: The bibliographic metadata collection is used as input for the META
        software. At this stage, it is checked whether or not the bibliographic entities
        have been previously integrated into our infrastructure (coming from other
        data sources). If so, the existing OMID is linked also to the new alternative
        identifiers of the new bibliographic resources. New metadata values, if any,
        are also integrated. A new OMID identifier is produced for entities never
        previously encountered, uniquely representing the bibliographic resource in
        OpenCitations. The outputs of the process are: (I) an updated version of the
        OpenCitations Meta collection that also includes the metadata of the bibliographic
        entities provided by the new source, and (II) a collection of provenance data.
        An internal database is constantly refreshed to preserve correspondence between
        IDs and the associated internal OMIDs.</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:
        justify\\\"><b>STEP 2</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400\\\">: Starting from
        the collection of citations expressed as directional links between identifiers
        of potentially any type (e.g., DOI-DOI, PMID-PMID, PMC-PMID, etc.), the INDEX
        software queries the internal database mapping IDs to OMIDs to produce an
        updated version of the OpenCitations Index: unique citations expressed as
        OMID-OMID links in different formats, accompanied by their corresponding provenance
        data.</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\"

        thing that spurred me to join is a rather unsatisfactory experience I had
        as a peer-reviewer, reviewing a manuscript where the experimental design was
        deeply insufficient. I won&#8217;t reveal for which open access journal I
        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,
        and <em>PCI Registered Reports</em> is one of the communities that will provide

        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>

        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus

        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        there was clear focus on BioBanking at the GGBN conference, I was additionally
        interested to hear that GGBN standards are useful from a rewilding perspective.
        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.
        As Jocelyn explained, \u201Cthe heart of the Nagoya protocol is community

        rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"}\\nis a global network of collections of genomic
        samples from across the\\nTree of Life, whose mission is to foster collaborations
        among\\nbiodiversity and biobanking repositories in order to ensure quality\\nstandards
        and harmonise exchange of material in accordance with national\\nand international
        legislation and conventions. GigaScience Press Data\\nScientist Chris Armit

        **Confronting the Global Decline in Biodiversity: The GGBN Perspective** {#confronting-the-global-decline-in-biodiversity-the-ggbn-perspective
        .wp-block-heading}\\n\\n**Oliver Ryder** (San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance
        IUCN-SSC Animal\\nBiobanking for Conservation Specialist Group, and [co-founder
        of\\nGenome10K](https://doi.org/10.1186/2047-217X-3-32){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer

        noopener\\\"}) introduced the Biodiversity Crisis with some\\ndizzying statistics.
        A study of 31,821 populations representing 5,230\\nspecies monitored across
        the globe showed a 69% decline in abundance.\\nThe decline is disproportionate
        across the globe with the megadiverse\\ncontinent of Africa showing a 66%
        reduction in biodiversity, and Latin\\nAmerica and the Caribbean showing a
        staggering 94% reduction in\\nbiodiversity. The message is clear -- we have
        to act now to conserve our\\nliving planet.\\n\\nConservation is a key focus
        of the GGBN, and this network -- coordinated\\nby the GGBN Secretariat hosted
        and supported by the National Museum of\\nNatural History, Smithsonian Institution,
        Washington, DC -- aims to\\nprovide the necessary Data Standards for BioBanked
        specimens in a global\\ncontext.\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image is-resized\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/UjgoqbzgJ_WcABy1q1hJW1PmZ73gnK-MJWkLvW7nKqusRmnNH_yXEP-7UeLp_Lv47_S0HH_mEe9jxAIa7Nq7hbD90mtFYc9nApbUc75GfAjtmE1BmVt-BCSCJdJCLLedfDtLVPExr2C4XrsR5H5NgCA\\\"\\ndecoding=\\\"async\\\"

        Biobanking for\\nConservation.*\\n\\nThe term 'Data Standards' is used to
        describe a set of terms and\\ncontrolled vocabularies designed to represent
        facts about a\\nsample/voucher. An additional important concept pertinent
        to the focus\\nof GGBN is the \\\"Digital Extended Specimen\\\", which is
        a cloud of\\ninformation around a vouchered specimen and which can include
        genomic\\nsequence data and metabolomics data.\\n\\n### **One Plan Approach**
        {#one-plan-approach .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nIn his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder
        highlighted the need for a common\\nstandard of good practice and information
        sharing. Towards this end,\\nOliver showcased the \\\"One Plan Approach\\\"
        which was formulated at the\\nIUCN World Conservation Congress 2020 at its
        session in Marseille,\\nFrance, and which \\\"urges the Secretariat and professional
        societies to\\npromote integration of *in situ* and *ex situ* conservation\\ninterventions\\\"
        and \\\"to ensure effective use of all available\\nconservation tools\\\".\\n\\nOf
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN\\nCommissions and
        Members to \\\"enable and support establishment of a global\\nnetwork of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species\\nconservation targets and
        operating to common standards of good practice\\nand information sharing.\\\"\\n\\n###
        **Genetic Rescue and Cloning** {#genetic-rescue-and-cloning .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nOliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost\\namongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue\\ninvolves an increase
        in fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated\\nindividuals into small,
        declining populations, and we have [explored\\nthis topic\\npreviously](http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"} with our publication of the genome of the\\ncritically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver\\nhighlighted how genetic rescue
        has been successful in [increasing the\\nfitness of the Florida\\npanther](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"} *Puma* *concolor coryi*, by moving female\\npanthers from Texas
        to Florida from the mid-1990s.\\n\\nMuch more technically challenging is the
        use of cloning to increase\\ngenetic fitness in endangered species. Oliver
        was swift to point out\\nthat this approach has been used for the critically
        endangered\\nPrzewalski's horse. The [first cloned *Equus\\nprzewalskii*](https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"} was foaled on August 6th 2020 and was named\\n'Kurt' in honour
        of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke of\\nSan Diego Zoo.\\n\\nIn
        the same year, a black-footed ferret named 'Elizabeth Ann' (born\\nDecember
        10, 2020) was [the first U.S. endangered species to be\\ncloned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer

        .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nA core focus of the GGBN conference was cryobanking
        of viable cells and\\ngametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking, **Jackie\\nMackenzie-Dodds**
        (Natural History Museum, London) referred to the\\ncryopreservation facilities
        as a \\\"treasure trove of molecules\\\". Jackie\\npointed out that viable
        cell lines are the most requested resource for\\nthe Natural History Museum
        BioBank, where they are used for the\\ngeneration of induced pluripotent stem
        cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.\\n\\nAnother important message from the GGBN
        conference was the need for Open\\nAccess BioBank facilities. Towards this
        end, an additional incentive for\\nresearchers and curators was provided by
        **Mudzuli Mavhunga** of\\nBiodiversity Biobanks South Africa (South African
        National Biodiversity\\nInstitute, Pretoria). Mudzuli highlighted that, if
        a South African\\nBioBank is awarded the status of Open Access, then it is
        eligible for\\nresource allocations through Biodiversity Biobanks South Africa
        (BBSA),\\nwhich is a great asset for a collection facility.\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        **Scalability of Cloning** {#scalability-of-cloning .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nSo
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? **Ben\\nNovak**
        of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk\\nentitled \\\"Important
        Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of\\nEndangered Species\\\",
        highlighted the example of passerines (perching\\nbirds) where programmed
        DNA loss is observed in some species. In\\npasserines such as the zebra finch
        (*Taeniopygia guttata*), there is a\\n[germ-line-restricted\\nchromosome](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer

        is represented exclusively in the germ cells, and is\\nabsent from somatic
        cells of the [bone\\nmarrow](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer

        species,\\nand can occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of\\nchromosome
        regions and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes.\\nHowever, this
        phenomenon, if observed in somatic tissues, can severely\\nimpact on the ability

        **Cryopreservation for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues** {#cryopreservation-for-biobanking-of-gametes-and-reproductive-tissues
        .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nOn the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive
        tissues, invaluable\\ninsights were provided by **Tullis Matson** of [Nature's\\nSAFE](https://www.natures-safe.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noreferrer

        Tullis\\nhas created Nature's SAFE with the intention of applying this know-how\\nof
        rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been on\\nfield
        trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An\\nimportant
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South\\nAfrica stay in
        South Africa, which is both an ethical and legal\\nobligation (see Sharing
        of Genomic Collections under the Nagoya Protocol\\nbelow).\\n\\nTullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal\\nsamples, and the role
        of Nature's SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian\\ntissue from the pied tamarin
        (*Saguinus bicolor*, critically\\nendangered), the lar gibbon (*Hylobates
        lar*, endangered), and the\\ncheetah (*Acinonyx jubatus*, vulnerable). As
        Tullis explained, \\\"working\\nwith leading reproductive scientists and cryobiologists,
        we use\\nstate-of-the-art methods to preserve cells in a way that maintains\\nviability,

        makes the consolidation even more extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers
        went from 47% of the market in 2000 to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest

        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access
        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such
        policies. The whole system rests on this logic of extraction and that&#8217;s
        what needs to be opposed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"Today's

        found that it&#8217;s a struggle to get people&#8217;s interest and that we
        have to be creative in order to educate about OA issues. Part of what I suspect
        makes advocating for OA difficult is the sort of singularity that comes from
        being &#8220;just the library,&#8221; the group that&#8217;s always talking

        people to participate in a workshop (there were over 20 people representing

        der deutschen\\nVersion](https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-8827-2023-INIT/de/pdf))\_mit\\nden
        aktuellen Herausforderungen des wissenschaftlichen\\nPublikationswesens befasst.\\n\\nBereits
        im Vorfeld der Sitzung der Wissenschaftsministerien wurden\\nverschiedene
        Versionen der Erkl\xE4rung \xF6ffentlich diskutiert (siehe z.B.\\n[Science\\nBusiness](https://sciencebusiness.net/news/Universities/leaked-eu-member-states-set-out-reform-scientific-publishing)\\nund
        [Times Higher\\nEducation](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/can-eu-make-parallel-publishing-system-work)).\\nIm
        Kern stand die Frage, inwiefern das EU-Papier den Fokus auf\\nFinanzierungs-
        und Gesch\xE4ftsmodelle abseits von Publikationsgeb\xFChren\\n(Article Processing
        Charges, APCs) legt und ob sogar eine Abkehr von der\\nUnterst\xFCtzung dieses
        Modells durch die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa betont\\nwird.\\n\\nSchweden
        hatte das Thema im Rahmen seiner EU-Ratspr\xE4sidentschaft\\naugegriffen und
        bereits im\\n[Februar](https://wisspub.net/2023/02/10/eu-wissenschaftsministerien-erortern-open-science/)\\nin
        einem Hintergrund-Papier adressiert. Schon in diesem Briefing Paper\\nwurde
        die Problematik steigender Preise f\xFCr die wissenschaftlichen\\nFachinformation
        betont.\_\\n\\nIn der jetzt verabschiedeten Version der Schlussfolgerungen
        die\\nForderung nach sofortigem Open Access f\xFCr wissenschaftliche\\nPublikationen,
        die im Rahmen der \xF6ffentlich gef\xF6rderten Forschung\\nentstehen, nochmals
        betont. Dieses Ziel wurde [bereits\\n2016](https://wisspub.net/2016/05/27/eu-und-g7-staaten-setzen-auf-open-science/)\\nvon
        den EU-Wissenschaftsministerien erhoben. Die\\nWissenschaftsminister:innen
        hatten damals einen Open-Access-Anteil von\\n100 % bis 2020 gefordert. Dieser
        Wert wurde bisher jedoch nicht\\nerreicht. In Deutschland liegt der Open-Access-Anteil
        zum Beispiel bei\\n[63](https://open-access-monitor.de/) Prozent, w\xE4hrend
        die Niederlande\\nim Publikationsjahr 2021 einen Anteil von\\n[82](https://www.openaccess.nl/en/in-the-netherlands/monitor)\_Prozent\\nerreichten.\\n\\n:::

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im\\nBereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen\\nbetont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und\\nFinanzierungsmodellen, die
        weder die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen\\nfinanziell belasten und sich
        durch angemessene und transparente Preise\\nauszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird
        beklagt, dass die steigenden Preise f\xFCr\\nwissenschaftliche Fachinformationen
        zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren und die\\n\xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil
        der Forschung belasten (Punkt\\n5).\\n\\nAufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen
        Verlagswesen wird in zwei\\nbemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung
        von nicht\\ngewinnorientierten Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:\\n\\n\\\"The
        Council of the European Union \\\\[...\\\\] highlights the importance of\\nnot-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not\\ncharge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their\\nwork without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the\\nvariety of models that do not depend on
        article processing charges or\\nsimilar per-unit charges and stresses the
        importance of supporting the\\ndevelopment of such models led by public research
        organisations; \\\\[...\\\\]\\nstresses that it is essential to avoid situations
        where researchers are\\nlimited in their choice of publication channels due
        to financial\\ncapacities rather than quality criteria, and where access to
        research\\npublications is restricted by paywalls\\\"\\n\\nZwar sind diese
        Unterstreichung und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner\\nSchritt auf dem
        Weg zur Gestaltung eines pluralistischen, transparenten\\nund nachhaltigen
        Systems der digtialen Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie\\nkommen jedoch zu einem
        Zeitpunkt, zu dem die Kritik an dem Modell der\\nPublikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.\\n\\nErst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den\\nUSA,
        als Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker\\nEinrichtungen, das
        APC-Modell [deutlich\\nkritisiert](https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/).\\nDie
        Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren\\nUngleichheit
        f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut\\nausgestatteten Regionen
        beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt\\nwerden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.\\n\\nAuch hat der \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame\\n[R\xFCcktritt](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5)
        des\\nEditorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender\\nAPCs
        den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die\\nzur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues\\nJournal\\n[gegr\xFCndet](https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/),\\ndas
        niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das\\nProblem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.\\n\\nUm die im obrigen
        Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu\\nadressieren, soll die Koordinierung
        innerhalb der EU und mit globalen\\nPartnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung von Chancengleichheit
        im wissenschaftlichen\\nPublizieren gef\xF6rdert werden (Absatz 7). Hierzu
        sollen auch abgestimmte\\nFinanzierungsstrategien entwickelt werden, um die
        Anzahl von\\nnot-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly publishing
        models in\\nEurope with no costs for authors or readers\\\" signifikant zu
        erh\xF6hen\\n(Absatz 11).\\n\\nAuch soll das Anliegen durch eine m\xF6gliche
        Beteiligung der\\nEU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe (ORE), der von
        der\\nEU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr Autor:innen
        aus den\\nEU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).\_\\n\\nIn
        der\\n[Pressemitteilung](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/)\\nwerden
        weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen\\naugegriffen:\_\\n\\n\\\"Some
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into\\ntheir national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly\\npublications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national\\nopen access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications\\nimmediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions\\nacknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like\\nwithin the framework of the European
        Open Science Cloud (EOSC), and\\nsuggest including open science monitoring
        in the European Research Area\\nmonitoring mechanism.\\\"\\n\\nDie Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des\\nwissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer\\nTr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu\\nbegr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote\\nund
        -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder\\ngemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig\\nzu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf\\ninternationaler
        Ebene zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Daf\xFCr sind, wie das\\nPapier richtig
        betont, abgestimmte F\xF6rderaktivit\xE4ten erforderlich, die\\nbeispielsweise
        in Deutschland, komplement\xE4r zu DEAL, dem\\nwissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizieren
        einen deutlichen\\nAufschwung geben.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/kz04m-s8z58\",\"guid\":\"https://wisspub.net/?p=20455\",\"id\":\"1c578558-1324-4493-b8af-84c49eabc52f\",\"image\":\"https://wisspub.files.wordpress.com/2023/05/bildschirmc2adfoto-2023-05-23-um-11.05.39.png?w=723\",\"language\":\"de\",\"published_at\":1684833413,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"Die
