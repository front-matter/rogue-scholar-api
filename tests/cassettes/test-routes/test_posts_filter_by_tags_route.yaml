        place in Aguascalientes, Mexico from October 17th to October 20th 2023 where

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">GGBN</a> is a global
        network of collections of genomic samples from across the Tree of Life, whose
        mission is to foster collaborations among biodiversity and biobanking repositories
        in order to ensure quality standards and harmonise exchange of material in
        accordance with national and international legislation and conventions. GigaScience
        Press Data Scientist Chris Armit attended the conference and reports below
        on some of the highlights.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Confronting
        the Global Decline in Biodiversity: The GGBN Perspective</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Oliver
        Ryder </strong>(San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance IUCN-SSC Animal Biobanking
        for Conservation Specialist Group, and <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1186/2047-217X-3-32\\\"

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">standards</a>) introduced
        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN
        Secretariat hosted and supported by the National Museum of Natural History,

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus
        przewalskii</em></a><em> </em>was foaled on August 6th 2020 and was named
        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells
        from Willa, a black-footed female ferret who died in the 1980s and who had
        no living descendants.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image is-resized\\\"><img

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate
        functioning iPSCs from frozen cell lines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        toolkit, and some of the challenges for conservation.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>From Fieldwork to BioBank</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Whereas
        there was clear focus on BioBanking at the GGBN conference, I was additionally
        interested to hear that GGBN standards are useful from a rewilding perspective.
        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental
        specimen metadata is used for decision making in projects such as the <a href=\\\"https://bethkaplin.org/current-projects/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">rewilding of Akagera
        National Park</a>. In this project \u2013 which is funded by the National
        Geographic Society \u2013 eDNA sampling of sediment cores and sample surface
        sediments are combined with natural history observations, and used to understand
        biodiversity patterns and assist park management in their plan for reintroductions.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        <a href=\\\"https://www.cbd.int/abs/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\">Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-sharing</a> became effective
        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.
        As Jocelyn explained, \u201Cthe heart of the Nagoya protocol is community
        consent \u2013 informed consent from indigenous people\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        place in Aguascalientes, Mexico from October 17th to October 20th 2023 where
        it was hosted by the Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes. The <a href=\\\"https://www.ggbn.org/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">GGBN</a> is a global
        network of collections of genomic samples from across the Tree of Life, whose
        mission is to foster collaborations among biodiversity and biobanking repositories
        in order to ensure quality standards and harmonise exchange of material in
        accordance with national and international legislation and conventions. GigaScience
        Press Data Scientist Chris Armit attended the conference and reports below
        on some of the highlights.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Confronting
        the Global Decline in Biodiversity: The GGBN Perspective</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Oliver
        Ryder </strong>(San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance IUCN-SSC Animal Biobanking
        for Conservation Specialist Group, and <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1186/2047-217X-3-32\\\"

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">standards</a>) introduced
        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN
        Secretariat hosted and supported by the National Museum of Natural History,
        Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC \u2013 aims to provide the necessary

        Ryder\u2019s keynote talk set the stage for Animal Biobanking for Conservation.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus
        przewalskii</em></a><em> </em>was foaled on August 6th 2020 and was named
        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells
        from Willa, a black-footed female ferret who died in the 1980s and who had
        no living descendants.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image is-resized\\\"><img

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate
        functioning iPSCs from frozen cell lines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        toolkit, and some of the challenges for conservation.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>From Fieldwork to BioBank</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Whereas
        there was clear focus on BioBanking at the GGBN conference, I was additionally
        interested to hear that GGBN standards are useful from a rewilding perspective.
        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental
        specimen metadata is used for decision making in projects such as the <a href=\\\"https://bethkaplin.org/current-projects/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">rewilding of Akagera
        National Park</a>. In this project \u2013 which is funded by the National
        Geographic Society \u2013 eDNA sampling of sediment cores and sample surface
        sediments are combined with natural history observations, and used to understand
        biodiversity patterns and assist park management in their plan for reintroductions.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        <a href=\\\"https://www.cbd.int/abs/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\">Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-sharing</a> became effective
        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.
        As Jocelyn explained, \u201Cthe heart of the Nagoya protocol is community
        consent \u2013 informed consent from indigenous people\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        makes the consolidation even more extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers
        went from 47% of the market in 2000 to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest

        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access
        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such
        policies. The whole system rests on this logic of extraction and that&#8217;s

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im Bereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen betont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und Finanzierungsmodellen, die weder
        die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen finanziell belasten und sich durch angemessene
        und transparente Preise auszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird beklagt, dass die steigenden
        Preise f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Fachinformationen zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren
        und die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil der Forschung belasten
        (Punkt 5).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Aufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen Verlagswesen
        wird in zwei bemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung von nicht gewinnorientierten
        Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe Council
        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article
        processing charges or similar per-unit charges and stresses the importance
        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [&#8230;] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers
        are limited in their choice of publication channels due to financial capacities
        rather than quality criteria, and where access to research publications is
        restricted by paywalls\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zwar sind diese Unterstreichung
        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung
        eines pluralistischen, transparenten und nachhaltigen Systems der digtialen
        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die
        Kritik an dem Modell der Publikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Erst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den USA, als
        Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker Einrichtungen, das APC-Modell<a
        href=\\\"https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/\\\">
        deutlich kritisiert</a>. Die Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        Ungleichheit f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut ausgestatteten
        Regionen beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt werden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch hat der
        \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5\\\">R\xFCcktritt</a>
        des Editorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender
        APCs den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die zur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues Journal <a href=\\\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/\\\">gegr\xFCndet</a>,
        das niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das Problem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Um
        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,
        soll die Koordinierung innerhalb der EU und mit globalen Partnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung
        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt
        werden, um die Anzahl von not-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly
        publishing models in Europe with no costs for authors or readers&#8221; signifikant
        zu erh\xF6hen (Absatz 11).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch soll das Anliegen durch
        eine m\xF6gliche Beteiligung der EU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe
        (ORE), der von der EU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr
        Autor:innen aus den EU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        der <a href=\\\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/\\\">Pressemitteilung</a>
        werden weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen augegriffen:&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CSome
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into their national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly publications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national open access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications immediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions acknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like within the framework of the European Open
        Science Cloud (EOSC), and suggest including open science monitoring in the
        European Research Area monitoring mechanism.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Die Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer Tr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu begr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote
        und -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder gemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig zu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf internationaler
        Ebene zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Daf\xFCr sind, wie das Papier richtig
        betont, abgestimmte F\xF6rderaktivit\xE4ten erforderlich, die beispielsweise
        in Deutschland, komplement\xE4r zu DEAL, dem wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizieren
        einen deutlichen Aufschwung geben.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/kz04m-s8z58\",\"guid\":\"https://wisspub.net/?p=20455\",\"id\":\"1c578558-1324-4493-b8af-84c49eabc52f\",\"image\":\"https://wisspub.files.wordpress.com/2023/05/bildschirmc2adfoto-2023-05-23-um-11.05.39.png?w=723\",\"language\":\"de\",\"published_at\":1684833413,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"Die

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im Bereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen betont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und Finanzierungsmodellen, die weder
        die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen finanziell belasten und sich durch angemessene
        und transparente Preise auszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird beklagt, dass die steigenden
        Preise f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Fachinformationen zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren
        und die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil der Forschung belasten
        (Punkt 5).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Aufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen Verlagswesen
        wird in zwei bemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung von nicht gewinnorientierten
        Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe Council
        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article
        processing charges or similar per-unit charges and stresses the importance
        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [&#8230;] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers
        are limited in their choice of publication channels due to financial capacities
        rather than quality criteria, and where access to research publications is
        restricted by paywalls\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zwar sind diese Unterstreichung
        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung
        eines pluralistischen, transparenten und nachhaltigen Systems der digtialen
        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die
        Kritik an dem Modell der Publikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Erst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den USA, als
        Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker Einrichtungen, das APC-Modell<a
        href=\\\"https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/\\\">
        deutlich kritisiert</a>. Die Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        Ungleichheit f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut ausgestatteten
        Regionen beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt werden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch hat der
        \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5\\\">R\xFCcktritt</a>
        des Editorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender
        APCs den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die zur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues Journal <a href=\\\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/\\\">gegr\xFCndet</a>,
        das niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das Problem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Um
        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,
        soll die Koordinierung innerhalb der EU und mit globalen Partnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung
        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt
        werden, um die Anzahl von not-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly
        publishing models in Europe with no costs for authors or readers&#8221; signifikant
        zu erh\xF6hen (Absatz 11).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch soll das Anliegen durch
        eine m\xF6gliche Beteiligung der EU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe
        (ORE), der von der EU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr
        Autor:innen aus den EU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        der <a href=\\\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/\\\">Pressemitteilung</a>
        werden weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen augegriffen:&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CSome
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into their national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly publications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national open access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications immediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions acknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like within the framework of the European Open
        Science Cloud (EOSC), and suggest including open science monitoring in the
        European Research Area monitoring mechanism.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Die Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer Tr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu begr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote
        und -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder gemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig zu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf internationaler
        Ebene zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Daf\xFCr sind, wie das Papier richtig
        betont, abgestimmte F\xF6rderaktivit\xE4ten erforderlich, die beispielsweise
        in Deutschland, komplement\xE4r zu DEAL, dem wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizieren
        einen deutlichen Aufschwung geben.</p>\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/kz04m-s8z58\",\"reference\":[],\"summary\":\"Die

        Small: Community-Owned Futures for Open Access Books\u201D</a>,</strong> April
        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the

        citations, sharing, and reuse?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This project combines
        two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to
        merge these interests.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q2.
        <strong>What questions or challenges were you setting out to address when
        you started this work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of our big questions
        in the project as a whole is to learn more about how researchers cite data
        in their work and for which purposes, and to think about how this varies by
        academic discipline. We started out by looking at this question bibliometrically
        in <a href=\\\"https://zenodo.org/record/4730857#.ZD9Mo-xByEs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">work</a> led by Anton with DataCite. The survey
        which we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question
        from a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em>
        they cite data (spoiler &#8211; it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a

        show intellectual debt), to help others to find data, or to support the validity
        of their research claims. Few respondents indicated that external factors,

        some significant disciplinary differences to this question, though. For example,
        social science and humanities (SHH) researchers selected that they cite data
        to acknowledge intellectual debt more frequently than expected. One possible
        explanation for this could be tied to common purposes for which our SSH respondents
        reuse data (e.g. to serve as the basis for a new study or to integrate sources
        to build an argument).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"

        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q5.

        perhaps some people may have tried to reuse data previously. I bring this

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q7. <strong>Why is your study important?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        data also show that most researchers who are citing data (in any way) report
        doing so for reasons in line with responsibly conducting research. This suggests
        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their
        communities and their own ethical principles. If this is the case, the questions
        I see which we need to consider are: When (and how) do we meet researchers
        where they are? When should their research practice be adapted to current
        technical requirements and our own recommendations for data citation, and
        when should those requirements and recommendations be adapted to reflect researchers\u2019
        actual practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\u2019s an important reminder that we
        need to take our time and involve research communities in the development
        of policies and systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>To stay up to date

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q1. <strong>What drew you into studying data
        citations, sharing, and reuse?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This project combines
        two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to
        merge these interests.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q2.
        <strong>What questions or challenges were you setting out to address when
        you started this work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of our big questions
        in the project as a whole is to learn more about how researchers cite data
        in their work and for which purposes, and to think about how this varies by
        academic discipline. We started out by looking at this question bibliometrically
        in <a href=\\\"https://zenodo.org/record/4730857#.ZD9Mo-xByEs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">work</a> led by Anton with DataCite. The survey
        which we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question
        from a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em>
        they cite data (spoiler &#8211; it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a
        reference list) and <em>what </em>they actually cite (another spoiler &#8211;\_
        it isn\u2019t always a dataset) but also to learn more about <em>why</em>
        they do so.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the strengths of the survey is the
        care that we took with constructing a sample which, to the best of our efforts,
        is representative of academic authors by discipline, as represented in the
        Web of Science. This took many discussions to think about how best to do this,
        and much planning, but it also allows our findings to be stronger and perhaps

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q7. <strong>Why is your study important?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        data also show that most researchers who are citing data (in any way) report
        doing so for reasons in line with responsibly conducting research. This suggests
        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their
        communities and their own ethical principles. If this is the case, the questions
        I see which we need to consider are: When (and how) do we meet researchers
        where they are? When should their research practice be adapted to current
        technical requirements and our own recommendations for data citation, and
        when should those requirements and recommendations be adapted to reflect researchers\u2019
        actual practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\u2019s an important reminder that we
        need to take our time and involve research communities in the development
        of policies and systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>To stay up to date

        Ryder </strong>(San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance IUCN-SSC Animal Biobanking

        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus

        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells
        from Willa, a black-footed female ferret who died in the 1980s and who had
        no living descendants.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image is-resized\\\"><img

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate
        functioning iPSCs from frozen cell lines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>From Fieldwork to BioBank</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Whereas
        there was clear focus on BioBanking at the GGBN conference, I was additionally
        interested to hear that GGBN standards are useful from a rewilding perspective.
        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental
        specimen metadata is used for decision making in projects such as the <a href=\\\"https://bethkaplin.org/current-projects/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">rewilding of Akagera
        National Park</a>. In this project \u2013 which is funded by the National

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.
        As Jocelyn explained, \u201Cthe heart of the Nagoya protocol is community
        consent \u2013 informed consent from indigenous people\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus

        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate
        functioning iPSCs from frozen cell lines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        there was clear focus on BioBanking at the GGBN conference, I was additionally
        interested to hear that GGBN standards are useful from a rewilding perspective.
        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.
        As Jocelyn explained, \u201Cthe heart of the Nagoya protocol is community
        consent \u2013 informed consent from indigenous people\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        makes the consolidation even more extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers
        went from 47% of the market in 2000 to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest

        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access
        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such
        policies. The whole system rests on this logic of extraction and that&#8217;s

        with department heads, administrators, and others. I imagine that getting

        Publikationswesens befasst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bereits im Vorfeld der Sitzung
        der Wissenschaftsministerien wurden verschiedene Versionen der Erkl\xE4rung
        \xF6ffentlich diskutiert (siehe z.B.<a href=\\\"https://sciencebusiness.net/news/Universities/leaked-eu-member-states-set-out-reform-scientific-publishing\\\">
        Science Business</a> und<a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/can-eu-make-parallel-publishing-system-work\\\">
        Times Higher Education</a>). Im Kern stand die Frage, inwiefern das EU-Papier
        den Fokus auf Finanzierungs- und Gesch\xE4ftsmodelle abseits von Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        (Article Processing Charges, APCs) legt und ob sogar eine Abkehr von der Unterst\xFCtzung
        dieses Modells durch die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa betont wird.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Schweden
        hatte das Thema im Rahmen seiner EU-Ratspr\xE4sidentschaft augegriffen und
        bereits im <a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2023/02/10/eu-wissenschaftsministerien-erortern-open-science/\\\">Februar</a>
        in einem Hintergrund-Papier adressiert. Schon in diesem Briefing Paper wurde
        die Problematik steigender Preise f\xFCr die wissenschaftlichen Fachinformation
        betont.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In der jetzt verabschiedeten Version der Schlussfolgerungen
        die Forderung nach sofortigem Open Access f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Publikationen,
        die im Rahmen der \xF6ffentlich gef\xF6rderten Forschung entstehen, nochmals
        betont. Dieses Ziel wurde<a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2016/05/27/eu-und-g7-staaten-setzen-auf-open-science/\\\">
        bereits 2016</a> von den EU-Wissenschaftsministerien erhoben. Die Wissenschaftsminister:innen
        hatten damals einen Open-Access-Anteil von 100 % bis 2020 gefordert. Dieser
        Wert wurde bisher jedoch nicht erreicht. In Deutschland liegt der Open-Access-Anteil
        zum Beispiel bei <a href=\\\"https://open-access-monitor.de/\\\">63</a> Prozent,
        w\xE4hrend die Niederlande im Publikationsjahr 2021 einen Anteil von <a href=\\\"https://www.openaccess.nl/en/in-the-netherlands/monitor\\\">82</a>\_Prozent

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im Bereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen betont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und Finanzierungsmodellen, die weder
        die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen finanziell belasten und sich durch angemessene
        und transparente Preise auszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird beklagt, dass die steigenden
        Preise f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Fachinformationen zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren
        und die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil der Forschung belasten
        (Punkt 5).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Aufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen Verlagswesen
        wird in zwei bemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung von nicht gewinnorientierten
        Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe Council
        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article
        processing charges or similar per-unit charges and stresses the importance
        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [&#8230;] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers
        are limited in their choice of publication channels due to financial capacities
        rather than quality criteria, and where access to research publications is
        restricted by paywalls\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zwar sind diese Unterstreichung
        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung
        eines pluralistischen, transparenten und nachhaltigen Systems der digtialen
        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die
        Kritik an dem Modell der Publikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Erst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den USA, als
        Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker Einrichtungen, das APC-Modell<a
        href=\\\"https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/\\\">
        deutlich kritisiert</a>. Die Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        Ungleichheit f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut ausgestatteten
        Regionen beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt werden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch hat der
        \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5\\\">R\xFCcktritt</a>
        des Editorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender
        APCs den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die zur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues Journal <a href=\\\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/\\\">gegr\xFCndet</a>,
        das niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das Problem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Um
        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,
        soll die Koordinierung innerhalb der EU und mit globalen Partnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung
        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt
        werden, um die Anzahl von not-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly
        publishing models in Europe with no costs for authors or readers&#8221; signifikant
        zu erh\xF6hen (Absatz 11).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch soll das Anliegen durch
        eine m\xF6gliche Beteiligung der EU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe
        (ORE), der von der EU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr
        Autor:innen aus den EU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        der <a href=\\\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/\\\">Pressemitteilung</a>
        werden weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen augegriffen:&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CSome
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into their national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly publications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national open access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications immediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions acknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like within the framework of the European Open
        Science Cloud (EOSC), and suggest including open science monitoring in the
        European Research Area monitoring mechanism.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Die Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer Tr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu begr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote
        und -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder gemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig zu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf internationaler

        der deutschen Version</a>)\_mit den aktuellen Herausforderungen des wissenschaftlichen
        Publikationswesens befasst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bereits im Vorfeld der Sitzung
        der Wissenschaftsministerien wurden verschiedene Versionen der Erkl\xE4rung
        \xF6ffentlich diskutiert (siehe z.B.<a href=\\\"https://sciencebusiness.net/news/Universities/leaked-eu-member-states-set-out-reform-scientific-publishing\\\">
        Science Business</a> und<a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/can-eu-make-parallel-publishing-system-work\\\">
        Times Higher Education</a>). Im Kern stand die Frage, inwiefern das EU-Papier
        den Fokus auf Finanzierungs- und Gesch\xE4ftsmodelle abseits von Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        (Article Processing Charges, APCs) legt und ob sogar eine Abkehr von der Unterst\xFCtzung
        dieses Modells durch die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa betont wird.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Schweden
        hatte das Thema im Rahmen seiner EU-Ratspr\xE4sidentschaft augegriffen und
        bereits im <a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2023/02/10/eu-wissenschaftsministerien-erortern-open-science/\\\">Februar</a>
        in einem Hintergrund-Papier adressiert. Schon in diesem Briefing Paper wurde
        die Problematik steigender Preise f\xFCr die wissenschaftlichen Fachinformation
        betont.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In der jetzt verabschiedeten Version der Schlussfolgerungen
        die Forderung nach sofortigem Open Access f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Publikationen,
        die im Rahmen der \xF6ffentlich gef\xF6rderten Forschung entstehen, nochmals
        betont. Dieses Ziel wurde<a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2016/05/27/eu-und-g7-staaten-setzen-auf-open-science/\\\">
        bereits 2016</a> von den EU-Wissenschaftsministerien erhoben. Die Wissenschaftsminister:innen
        hatten damals einen Open-Access-Anteil von 100 % bis 2020 gefordert. Dieser
        Wert wurde bisher jedoch nicht erreicht. In Deutschland liegt der Open-Access-Anteil
        zum Beispiel bei <a href=\\\"https://open-access-monitor.de/\\\">63</a> Prozent,
        w\xE4hrend die Niederlande im Publikationsjahr 2021 einen Anteil von <a href=\\\"https://www.openaccess.nl/en/in-the-netherlands/monitor\\\">82</a>\_Prozent

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im Bereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen betont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und Finanzierungsmodellen, die weder
        die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen finanziell belasten und sich durch angemessene
        und transparente Preise auszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird beklagt, dass die steigenden
        Preise f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Fachinformationen zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren
        und die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil der Forschung belasten
        (Punkt 5).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Aufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen Verlagswesen
        wird in zwei bemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung von nicht gewinnorientierten
        Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe Council
        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article
        processing charges or similar per-unit charges and stresses the importance
        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [&#8230;] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers
        are limited in their choice of publication channels due to financial capacities
        rather than quality criteria, and where access to research publications is
        restricted by paywalls\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zwar sind diese Unterstreichung
        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung
        eines pluralistischen, transparenten und nachhaltigen Systems der digtialen
        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die
        Kritik an dem Modell der Publikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Erst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den USA, als
        Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker Einrichtungen, das APC-Modell<a
        href=\\\"https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/\\\">
        deutlich kritisiert</a>. Die Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        Ungleichheit f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut ausgestatteten
        Regionen beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt werden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch hat der
        \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5\\\">R\xFCcktritt</a>
        des Editorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender
        APCs den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die zur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues Journal <a href=\\\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/\\\">gegr\xFCndet</a>,
        das niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das Problem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Um
        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,
        soll die Koordinierung innerhalb der EU und mit globalen Partnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung
        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt
        werden, um die Anzahl von not-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly
        publishing models in Europe with no costs for authors or readers&#8221; signifikant
        zu erh\xF6hen (Absatz 11).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch soll das Anliegen durch
        eine m\xF6gliche Beteiligung der EU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe
        (ORE), der von der EU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr
        Autor:innen aus den EU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        der <a href=\\\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/\\\">Pressemitteilung</a>
        werden weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen augegriffen:&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CSome
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into their national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly publications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national open access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications immediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions acknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like within the framework of the European Open
        Science Cloud (EOSC), and suggest including open science monitoring in the
        European Research Area monitoring mechanism.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Die Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer Tr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu begr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote
        und -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder gemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig zu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf internationaler
        Ebene zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Daf\xFCr sind, wie das Papier richtig
        betont, abgestimmte F\xF6rderaktivit\xE4ten erforderlich, die beispielsweise
        in Deutschland, komplement\xE4r zu DEAL, dem wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizieren

        Small: Community-Owned Futures for Open Access Books\u201D</a>,</strong> April
        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        citations, sharing, and reuse?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This project combines
        two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to
        merge these interests.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q2.
        <strong>What questions or challenges were you setting out to address when
        you started this work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of our big questions
        in the project as a whole is to learn more about how researchers cite data
        in their work and for which purposes, and to think about how this varies by
        academic discipline. We started out by looking at this question bibliometrically
        in <a href=\\\"https://zenodo.org/record/4730857#.ZD9Mo-xByEs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">work</a> led by Anton with DataCite. The survey
        which we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question
        from a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em>
        they cite data (spoiler &#8211; it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a
        reference list) and <em>what </em>they actually cite (another spoiler &#8211;\_
        it isn\u2019t always a dataset) but also to learn more about <em>why</em>
        they do so.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the strengths of the survey is the
        care that we took with constructing a sample which, to the best of our efforts,
        is representative of academic authors by discipline, as represented in the
        Web of Science. This took many discussions to think about how best to do this,
        and much planning, but it also allows our findings to be stronger and perhaps
        more generalizable to the broader population.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q3.
        <strong>What motivates researchers who cite data to do so?\_</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across
        the entire sample, we found that the majority of reasons might be construed
        as motivations which reflect \u2018ideal\u2019 research practice (e.g. to
        show intellectual debt), to help others to find data, or to support the validity
        of their research claims. Few respondents indicated that external factors,
        namely being advised to do so by journals or publishers, was a motivating
        factor in their decision to cite data.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We did find
        some significant disciplinary differences to this question, though. For example,
        social science and humanities (SHH) researchers selected that they cite data
        to acknowledge intellectual debt more frequently than expected. One possible
        explanation for this could be tied to common purposes for which our SSH respondents
        reuse data (e.g. to serve as the basis for a new study or to integrate sources
        to build an argument).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q4. <strong>How do researchers prefer others
        to cite their work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Around 84% of all respondents
        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q5.
        <strong>In the survey, more than 450 respondents said that they do not reuse
        data. Why do some researchers not reuse data?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We
        asked people to self-identify as being a person who reuses data or one who
        does not. This classification itself is perhaps a bit problematic, as we know
        from <a href=\\\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2705/chapter-abstract/73133/Non-Users-Also-Matter?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past work</a> in Science
        and Technology Studies that \u2018usage\u2019 of something\u2014be that a
        car or the Internet or research data\u2014exists on a spectrum. A researcher
        may reuse data to teach a class once per year, or they may be involved in
        a years-long comparative study and be reusing data daily, or they may not
        reuse data at all.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That said, the most frequently selected
        options were that reusing data was not relevant to their research methods
        or in their research communities. Other less frequently selected reasons\u2014such
        as a lack of relevant data or difficulties finding data\u2014indicate that
        perhaps some people may have tried to reuse data previously. I bring this
        up as I think it is important to remember that this variation in practice
        exists, that not everyone is a re-user of data, and that other ways of conducting
        research are also valuable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q6.
        <strong>What are your most interesting or surprising findings?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps
        most surprising to me at a high level was how much our data had to say about
        the practices of SSH researchers. We found that SSH researchers are the only
        disciplinary groups who prefer that others cite or mention their own data,
        as opposed to other data objects (e.g. an article or a collection of data).
        This contrasts <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23529\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past scientometric work</a>
        showing that SSH scholars cite \u2018data studies,\u2019 rather than individual
        data files.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We were also able to identify unique differences
        between social scientists and humanities scholars, such as the tendency for
        humanities scholars to integrate data more than most other disciplinary groups
        or the pattern of social scientists to refer to related publications (rather
        than data) less than other groups.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q7. <strong>Why is your study important?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        data also show that most researchers who are citing data (in any way) report
        doing so for reasons in line with responsibly conducting research. This suggests
        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their
        communities and their own ethical principles. If this is the case, the questions
        I see which we need to consider are: When (and how) do we meet researchers
        where they are? When should their research practice be adapted to current
        technical requirements and our own recommendations for data citation, and
        when should those requirements and recommendations be adapted to reflect researchers\u2019
        actual practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\u2019s an important reminder that we
        need to take our time and involve research communities in the development
        of policies and systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>To stay up to date

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q4. <strong>How do researchers prefer others
        to cite their work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Around 84% of all respondents
        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q5.
        <strong>In the survey, more than 450 respondents said that they do not reuse
        data. Why do some researchers not reuse data?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We
        asked people to self-identify as being a person who reuses data or one who
        does not. This classification itself is perhaps a bit problematic, as we know
        from <a href=\\\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2705/chapter-abstract/73133/Non-Users-Also-Matter?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past work</a> in Science
        and Technology Studies that \u2018usage\u2019 of something\u2014be that a
        car or the Internet or research data\u2014exists on a spectrum. A researcher
        may reuse data to teach a class once per year, or they may be involved in
        a years-long comparative study and be reusing data daily, or they may not
        reuse data at all.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That said, the most frequently selected
        options were that reusing data was not relevant to their research methods
        or in their research communities. Other less frequently selected reasons\u2014such
        as a lack of relevant data or difficulties finding data\u2014indicate that
        perhaps some people may have tried to reuse data previously. I bring this
        up as I think it is important to remember that this variation in practice
        exists, that not everyone is a re-user of data, and that other ways of conducting
        research are also valuable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q6.
        <strong>What are your most interesting or surprising findings?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps
        most surprising to me at a high level was how much our data had to say about
        the practices of SSH researchers. We found that SSH researchers are the only
        disciplinary groups who prefer that others cite or mention their own data,
        as opposed to other data objects (e.g. an article or a collection of data).
        This contrasts <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23529\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past scientometric work</a>
        showing that SSH scholars cite \u2018data studies,\u2019 rather than individual
        data files.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We were also able to identify unique differences
        between social scientists and humanities scholars, such as the tendency for
        humanities scholars to integrate data more than most other disciplinary groups
        or the pattern of social scientists to refer to related publications (rather
        than data) less than other groups.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q7. <strong>Why is your study important?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        data also show that most researchers who are citing data (in any way) report
        doing so for reasons in line with responsibly conducting research. This suggests
        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their
        communities and their own ethical principles. If this is the case, the questions
        I see which we need to consider are: When (and how) do we meet researchers
        where they are? When should their research practice be adapted to current
        technical requirements and our own recommendations for data citation, and
        when should those requirements and recommendations be adapted to reflect researchers\u2019
        actual practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\u2019s an important reminder that we
        need to take our time and involve research communities in the development
        of policies and systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>To stay up to date

        the Global Decline in Biodiversity: The GGBN Perspective</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Oliver
        Ryder </strong>(San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance IUCN-SSC Animal Biobanking

        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus

        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells
        from Willa, a black-footed female ferret who died in the 1980s and who had

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben

        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.
        As Jocelyn explained, \u201Cthe heart of the Nagoya protocol is community

        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the

        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks

        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"

        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.

        makes the consolidation even more extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers
        went from 47% of the market in 2000 to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest

        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays

        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking

        processes and supports within an institution can, I&#8217;ve noticed, demand
        a bit of effort to change. When we speak of <strong>open scholarship</strong>
        or <strong>open science</strong>, many aspects tie-in or lead out from those
        concepts, which makes the whole prospect of institutional change quite complex.
        I&#8217;m very excited about the efforts so far that the Open Science Working
        Group (of which I&#8217;m a participant) at Concordia University has undertaken
        and accomplished. These include an initial report on &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.11573/spectrum.library.concordia.ca.00992647\\\"><strong>Recommendations

        course, the Library is always doing outreach about open access (OA). In the
        past I&#8217;ve organized activities, events, and <a href=\\\"https://chroknowlogy.ca/intellectual-liberty/2022/talk-broad-value-open-access/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"post\\\" data-id=\\\"64563\\\">projects</a> for <a href=\\\"https://www.openaccessweek.org/\\\">open
        access week</a>. I can see how frequently our modern research practices, which
        involve digital techniques are enabled by the various forms of open: open
        source, open data, open protocols, open access, etc. However, I&#8217;ve always
        found that it&#8217;s a struggle to get people&#8217;s interest and that we
        have to be creative in order to educate about OA issues. Part of what I suspect
        makes advocating for OA difficult is the sort of singularity that comes from
        being &#8220;just the library,&#8221; the group that&#8217;s always talking
        about it. So when this Open Science Working Group formed, I was excited about
        its multidisciplinary nature and that it included both students and faculty.
        I think that really helps to broaden involvement across the university.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        working group, led by colleagues Krista Byers-Heinlein (who is also Concordia
        University Research Chair in Bilingualism and Open Science) and Nicol\xE1s
        Alessandroni, initiated the effort through a day-long <a href=\\\"https://www.concordia.ca/cuevents/artsci/2022/05/27/open-science-concordia.html\\\">conference
        on open science</a> in 2022. Later they established the working group by inviting
        people to participate in a workshop (there were over 20 people representing
        many disciplines). The workshop operated through a modified form of DORA&#8217;s
        <a href=\\\"https://sfdora.org/resource/workshop-toolkit-to-introduce-the-space-rubric/\\\">SPACE
        rubric</a>, which was designed for academic institutions to use toward improving
        their policies. I think using that tool to organize such a large group of
        people toward a practical outcome was extremely beneficial. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        more meetings, discussions, and revisions the working group was able to produce
        a set of <a href=\\\"https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/id/eprint/992647/\\\">recommendations</a>
        to bolster open scholarship throughout the university. It addresses many issues,
        including existing policies, outreach, inter-institutional work, position
        principles, open education, resources, and more. Of course, this is not the
        end of the process. Among other things, next steps include focused discussions
        with department heads, administrators, and others. I imagine that getting
        to a place where open scholarship/open science is well-understood and hopefully

        institution can, I&#8217;ve noticed, demand a bit of effort to change. When
        we speak of <strong>open scholarship</strong> or <strong>open science</strong>,
        many aspects tie-in or lead out from those concepts, which makes the whole
        prospect of institutional change quite complex. I&#8217;m very excited about
        the efforts so far that the Open Science Working Group (of which I&#8217;m
        a participant) at Concordia University has undertaken and accomplished. These
        include an initial report on &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.11573/spectrum.library.concordia.ca.00992647\\\"><strong>Recommendations
        for Fostering Open Science at Concordia University</strong></a>&#8221; (DOI:
        10.11573/spectrum.library.concordia.ca.00992647) </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<!--more-->\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        course, the Library is always doing outreach about open access (OA). In the
        past I&#8217;ve organized activities, events, and <a href=\\\"https://chroknowlogy.ca/intellectual-liberty/2022/talk-broad-value-open-access/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"post\\\" data-id=\\\"64563\\\">projects</a> for <a href=\\\"https://www.openaccessweek.org/\\\">open
        access week</a>. I can see how frequently our modern research practices, which
        involve digital techniques are enabled by the various forms of open: open
        source, open data, open protocols, open access, etc. However, I&#8217;ve always
        found that it&#8217;s a struggle to get people&#8217;s interest and that we
        have to be creative in order to educate about OA issues. Part of what I suspect
        makes advocating for OA difficult is the sort of singularity that comes from
        being &#8220;just the library,&#8221; the group that&#8217;s always talking
        about it. So when this Open Science Working Group formed, I was excited about
        its multidisciplinary nature and that it included both students and faculty.
        I think that really helps to broaden involvement across the university.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        working group, led by colleagues Krista Byers-Heinlein (who is also Concordia
        University Research Chair in Bilingualism and Open Science) and Nicol\xE1s
        Alessandroni, initiated the effort through a day-long <a href=\\\"https://www.concordia.ca/cuevents/artsci/2022/05/27/open-science-concordia.html\\\">conference
        on open science</a> in 2022. Later they established the working group by inviting
        people to participate in a workshop (there were over 20 people representing
        many disciplines). The workshop operated through a modified form of DORA&#8217;s
        <a href=\\\"https://sfdora.org/resource/workshop-toolkit-to-introduce-the-space-rubric/\\\">SPACE
        rubric</a>, which was designed for academic institutions to use toward improving
        their policies. I think using that tool to organize such a large group of
        people toward a practical outcome was extremely beneficial. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        more meetings, discussions, and revisions the working group was able to produce
        a set of <a href=\\\"https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/id/eprint/992647/\\\">recommendations</a>
        to bolster open scholarship throughout the university. It addresses many issues,
        including existing policies, outreach, inter-institutional work, position
        principles, open education, resources, and more. Of course, this is not the
        end of the process. Among other things, next steps include focused discussions
        with department heads, administrators, and others. I imagine that getting
        to a place where open scholarship/open science is well-understood and hopefully
        a default institutional position for research and education will require ongoing
        work. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The recommendations in the report tend to be specific
        within the context of Concordia University but I felt it worthwhile to write
        about here because the process, the findings, and the recommendations may
        be of interest to others. Perhaps you would like to try something similar

        der deutschen Version</a>)\_mit den aktuellen Herausforderungen des wissenschaftlichen
        Publikationswesens befasst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bereits im Vorfeld der Sitzung
        der Wissenschaftsministerien wurden verschiedene Versionen der Erkl\xE4rung
        \xF6ffentlich diskutiert (siehe z.B.<a href=\\\"https://sciencebusiness.net/news/Universities/leaked-eu-member-states-set-out-reform-scientific-publishing\\\">
        Science Business</a> und<a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/can-eu-make-parallel-publishing-system-work\\\">
        Times Higher Education</a>). Im Kern stand die Frage, inwiefern das EU-Papier
        den Fokus auf Finanzierungs- und Gesch\xE4ftsmodelle abseits von Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        (Article Processing Charges, APCs) legt und ob sogar eine Abkehr von der Unterst\xFCtzung
        dieses Modells durch die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa betont wird.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Schweden
        hatte das Thema im Rahmen seiner EU-Ratspr\xE4sidentschaft augegriffen und
        bereits im <a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2023/02/10/eu-wissenschaftsministerien-erortern-open-science/\\\">Februar</a>
        in einem Hintergrund-Papier adressiert. Schon in diesem Briefing Paper wurde
        die Problematik steigender Preise f\xFCr die wissenschaftlichen Fachinformation
        betont.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In der jetzt verabschiedeten Version der Schlussfolgerungen
        die Forderung nach sofortigem Open Access f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Publikationen,
        die im Rahmen der \xF6ffentlich gef\xF6rderten Forschung entstehen, nochmals
        betont. Dieses Ziel wurde<a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2016/05/27/eu-und-g7-staaten-setzen-auf-open-science/\\\">
        bereits 2016</a> von den EU-Wissenschaftsministerien erhoben. Die Wissenschaftsminister:innen
        hatten damals einen Open-Access-Anteil von 100 % bis 2020 gefordert. Dieser
        Wert wurde bisher jedoch nicht erreicht. In Deutschland liegt der Open-Access-Anteil
        zum Beispiel bei <a href=\\\"https://open-access-monitor.de/\\\">63</a> Prozent,
        w\xE4hrend die Niederlande im Publikationsjahr 2021 einen Anteil von <a href=\\\"https://www.openaccess.nl/en/in-the-netherlands/monitor\\\">82</a>\_Prozent

        die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen finanziell belasten und sich durch angemessene

        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article
        processing charges or similar per-unit charges and stresses the importance
        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [&#8230;] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers
        are limited in their choice of publication channels due to financial capacities
        rather than quality criteria, and where access to research publications is
        restricted by paywalls\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zwar sind diese Unterstreichung
        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung
        eines pluralistischen, transparenten und nachhaltigen Systems der digtialen
        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die

        href=\\\"https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/\\\">
        deutlich kritisiert</a>. Die Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        Ungleichheit f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut ausgestatteten
        Regionen beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt werden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch hat der

        des Editorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender
        APCs den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die zur\xFCckgetretenen

        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,
        soll die Koordinierung innerhalb der EU und mit globalen Partnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung
        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt
        werden, um die Anzahl von not-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly
        publishing models in Europe with no costs for authors or readers&#8221; signifikant
        zu erh\xF6hen (Absatz 11).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch soll das Anliegen durch

        and guidelines to make scholarly publications immediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions acknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like within the framework of the European Open

        der Wissenschaftsministerien wurden verschiedene Versionen der Erkl\xE4rung
        \xF6ffentlich diskutiert (siehe z.B.<a href=\\\"https://sciencebusiness.net/news/Universities/leaked-eu-member-states-set-out-reform-scientific-publishing\\\">
        Science Business</a> und<a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/can-eu-make-parallel-publishing-system-work\\\">
        Times Higher Education</a>). Im Kern stand die Frage, inwiefern das EU-Papier
        den Fokus auf Finanzierungs- und Gesch\xE4ftsmodelle abseits von Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        (Article Processing Charges, APCs) legt und ob sogar eine Abkehr von der Unterst\xFCtzung
        dieses Modells durch die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa betont wird.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Schweden
        hatte das Thema im Rahmen seiner EU-Ratspr\xE4sidentschaft augegriffen und
        bereits im <a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2023/02/10/eu-wissenschaftsministerien-erortern-open-science/\\\">Februar</a>
        in einem Hintergrund-Papier adressiert. Schon in diesem Briefing Paper wurde
        die Problematik steigender Preise f\xFCr die wissenschaftlichen Fachinformation
        betont.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In der jetzt verabschiedeten Version der Schlussfolgerungen
        die Forderung nach sofortigem Open Access f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Publikationen,
        die im Rahmen der \xF6ffentlich gef\xF6rderten Forschung entstehen, nochmals
        betont. Dieses Ziel wurde<a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2016/05/27/eu-und-g7-staaten-setzen-auf-open-science/\\\">
        bereits 2016</a> von den EU-Wissenschaftsministerien erhoben. Die Wissenschaftsminister:innen
        hatten damals einen Open-Access-Anteil von 100 % bis 2020 gefordert. Dieser
        Wert wurde bisher jedoch nicht erreicht. In Deutschland liegt der Open-Access-Anteil
        zum Beispiel bei <a href=\\\"https://open-access-monitor.de/\\\">63</a> Prozent,
        w\xE4hrend die Niederlande im Publikationsjahr 2021 einen Anteil von <a href=\\\"https://www.openaccess.nl/en/in-the-netherlands/monitor\\\">82</a>\_Prozent

        Small: Community-Owned Futures for Open Access Books\u201D</a>,</strong> April
        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q1. <strong>What drew you into studying data
        citations, sharing, and reuse?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This project combines
        two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to
        merge these interests.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q2.
        <strong>What questions or challenges were you setting out to address when
        you started this work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of our big questions
        in the project as a whole is to learn more about how researchers cite data
        in their work and for which purposes, and to think about how this varies by
        academic discipline. We started out by looking at this question bibliometrically
        in <a href=\\\"https://zenodo.org/record/4730857#.ZD9Mo-xByEs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">work</a> led by Anton with DataCite. The survey
        which we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question
        from a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em>
        they cite data (spoiler &#8211; it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a
        reference list) and <em>what </em>they actually cite (another spoiler &#8211;\_
        it isn\u2019t always a dataset) but also to learn more about <em>why</em>
        they do so.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the strengths of the survey is the
        care that we took with constructing a sample which, to the best of our efforts,
        is representative of academic authors by discipline, as represented in the
        Web of Science. This took many discussions to think about how best to do this,
        and much planning, but it also allows our findings to be stronger and perhaps
        more generalizable to the broader population.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q3.
        <strong>What motivates researchers who cite data to do so?\_</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across
        the entire sample, we found that the majority of reasons might be construed
        as motivations which reflect \u2018ideal\u2019 research practice (e.g. to
        show intellectual debt), to help others to find data, or to support the validity
        of their research claims. Few respondents indicated that external factors,
        namely being advised to do so by journals or publishers, was a motivating
        factor in their decision to cite data.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We did find
        some significant disciplinary differences to this question, though. For example,
        social science and humanities (SHH) researchers selected that they cite data
        to acknowledge intellectual debt more frequently than expected. One possible
        explanation for this could be tied to common purposes for which our SSH respondents
        reuse data (e.g. to serve as the basis for a new study or to integrate sources
        to build an argument).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q4. <strong>How do researchers prefer others
        to cite their work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Around 84% of all respondents
        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q5.
        <strong>In the survey, more than 450 respondents said that they do not reuse
        data. Why do some researchers not reuse data?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We
        asked people to self-identify as being a person who reuses data or one who
        does not. This classification itself is perhaps a bit problematic, as we know
        from <a href=\\\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2705/chapter-abstract/73133/Non-Users-Also-Matter?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past work</a> in Science
        and Technology Studies that \u2018usage\u2019 of something\u2014be that a
        car or the Internet or research data\u2014exists on a spectrum. A researcher
        may reuse data to teach a class once per year, or they may be involved in
        a years-long comparative study and be reusing data daily, or they may not
        reuse data at all.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That said, the most frequently selected
        options were that reusing data was not relevant to their research methods
        or in their research communities. Other less frequently selected reasons\u2014such
        as a lack of relevant data or difficulties finding data\u2014indicate that
        perhaps some people may have tried to reuse data previously. I bring this
        up as I think it is important to remember that this variation in practice
        exists, that not everyone is a re-user of data, and that other ways of conducting
        research are also valuable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q6.
        <strong>What are your most interesting or surprising findings?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps
        most surprising to me at a high level was how much our data had to say about
        the practices of SSH researchers. We found that SSH researchers are the only
        disciplinary groups who prefer that others cite or mention their own data,
        as opposed to other data objects (e.g. an article or a collection of data).
        This contrasts <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23529\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past scientometric work</a>
        showing that SSH scholars cite \u2018data studies,\u2019 rather than individual
        data files.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We were also able to identify unique differences
        between social scientists and humanities scholars, such as the tendency for
        humanities scholars to integrate data more than most other disciplinary groups
        or the pattern of social scientists to refer to related publications (rather
        than data) less than other groups.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q7. <strong>Why is your study important?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        data also show that most researchers who are citing data (in any way) report
        doing so for reasons in line with responsibly conducting research. This suggests
        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their
        communities and their own ethical principles. If this is the case, the questions
        I see which we need to consider are: When (and how) do we meet researchers
        where they are? When should their research practice be adapted to current
        technical requirements and our own recommendations for data citation, and
        when should those requirements and recommendations be adapted to reflect researchers\u2019
        actual practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\u2019s an important reminder that we
        need to take our time and involve research communities in the development
        of policies and systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>To stay up to date

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q1. <strong>What drew you into studying data
        citations, sharing, and reuse?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This project combines
        two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to
        merge these interests.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q2.
        <strong>What questions or challenges were you setting out to address when
        you started this work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of our big questions
        in the project as a whole is to learn more about how researchers cite data
        in their work and for which purposes, and to think about how this varies by
        academic discipline. We started out by looking at this question bibliometrically
        in <a href=\\\"https://zenodo.org/record/4730857#.ZD9Mo-xByEs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">work</a> led by Anton with DataCite. The survey
        which we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question
        from a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em>
        they cite data (spoiler &#8211; it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a
        reference list) and <em>what </em>they actually cite (another spoiler &#8211;\_
        it isn\u2019t always a dataset) but also to learn more about <em>why</em>
        they do so.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the strengths of the survey is the
        care that we took with constructing a sample which, to the best of our efforts,
        is representative of academic authors by discipline, as represented in the
        Web of Science. This took many discussions to think about how best to do this,
        and much planning, but it also allows our findings to be stronger and perhaps
        more generalizable to the broader population.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q3.
        <strong>What motivates researchers who cite data to do so?\_</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across
        the entire sample, we found that the majority of reasons might be construed
        as motivations which reflect \u2018ideal\u2019 research practice (e.g. to
        show intellectual debt), to help others to find data, or to support the validity
        of their research claims. Few respondents indicated that external factors,
        namely being advised to do so by journals or publishers, was a motivating
        factor in their decision to cite data.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We did find
        some significant disciplinary differences to this question, though. For example,
        social science and humanities (SHH) researchers selected that they cite data
        to acknowledge intellectual debt more frequently than expected. One possible
        explanation for this could be tied to common purposes for which our SSH respondents
        reuse data (e.g. to serve as the basis for a new study or to integrate sources
        to build an argument).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q4. <strong>How do researchers prefer others
        to cite their work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Around 84% of all respondents
        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q5.
        <strong>In the survey, more than 450 respondents said that they do not reuse
        data. Why do some researchers not reuse data?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We
        asked people to self-identify as being a person who reuses data or one who
        does not. This classification itself is perhaps a bit problematic, as we know
        from <a href=\\\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2705/chapter-abstract/73133/Non-Users-Also-Matter?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past work</a> in Science
        and Technology Studies that \u2018usage\u2019 of something\u2014be that a
        car or the Internet or research data\u2014exists on a spectrum. A researcher
        may reuse data to teach a class once per year, or they may be involved in
        a years-long comparative study and be reusing data daily, or they may not
        reuse data at all.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That said, the most frequently selected
        options were that reusing data was not relevant to their research methods
        or in their research communities. Other less frequently selected reasons\u2014such
        as a lack of relevant data or difficulties finding data\u2014indicate that
        perhaps some people may have tried to reuse data previously. I bring this
        up as I think it is important to remember that this variation in practice
        exists, that not everyone is a re-user of data, and that other ways of conducting
        research are also valuable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q6.
        <strong>What are your most interesting or surprising findings?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps
        most surprising to me at a high level was how much our data had to say about
        the practices of SSH researchers. We found that SSH researchers are the only
        disciplinary groups who prefer that others cite or mention their own data,
        as opposed to other data objects (e.g. an article or a collection of data).
        This contrasts <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23529\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past scientometric work</a>
        showing that SSH scholars cite \u2018data studies,\u2019 rather than individual
        data files.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We were also able to identify unique differences
        between social scientists and humanities scholars, such as the tendency for
        humanities scholars to integrate data more than most other disciplinary groups
        or the pattern of social scientists to refer to related publications (rather
        than data) less than other groups.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q7. <strong>Why is your study important?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        data also show that most researchers who are citing data (in any way) report
        doing so for reasons in line with responsibly conducting research. This suggests
        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their
        communities and their own ethical principles. If this is the case, the questions
        I see which we need to consider are: When (and how) do we meet researchers
        where they are? When should their research practice be adapted to current
        technical requirements and our own recommendations for data citation, and
        when should those requirements and recommendations be adapted to reflect researchers\u2019
        actual practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\u2019s an important reminder that we
        need to take our time and involve research communities in the development
        of policies and systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>To stay up to date

        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate
        functioning iPSCs from frozen cell lines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        there was clear focus on BioBanking at the GGBN conference, I was additionally
        interested to hear that GGBN standards are useful from a rewilding perspective.
        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental
        specimen metadata is used for decision making in projects such as the <a href=\\\"https://bethkaplin.org/current-projects/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">rewilding of Akagera

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.
        As Jocelyn explained, \u201Cthe heart of the Nagoya protocol is community
        consent \u2013 informed consent from indigenous people\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The

        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen

        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the

        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks

        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben

        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the

        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits

        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.

        makes the consolidation even more extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers
        went from 47% of the market in 2000 to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest
        publishers from 54% to controlling 83% of the corpus.</p>\\n<cite>https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/10/30/quantifying-consolidation-in-the-scholarly-journals-market/</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s
        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access
        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such
        policies. The whole system rests on this logic of extraction and that&#8217;s
        what needs to be opposed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/z8017-00204\",\"guid\":\"https://www.samuelmoore.org/?p=1437\",\"id\":\"95fef4ed-6274-47ed-a682-494ef1cb85ef\",\"image\":\"https://www.samuelmoore.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/R229.aa364024.jpg\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1698678686,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"Today\u2019s

        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access
        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such
        policies. The whole system rests on this logic of extraction and that&#8217;s
        what needs to be opposed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/z8017-00204\",\"reference\":[],\"summary\":\"Today\u2019s

        involve digital techniques are enabled by the various forms of open: open
        source, open data, open protocols, open access, etc. However, I&#8217;ve always
        found that it&#8217;s a struggle to get people&#8217;s interest and that we
        have to be creative in order to educate about OA issues. Part of what I suspect
        makes advocating for OA difficult is the sort of singularity that comes from
        being &#8220;just the library,&#8221; the group that&#8217;s always talking
        about it. So when this Open Science Working Group formed, I was excited about

        on open science</a> in 2022. Later they established the working group by inviting
        people to participate in a workshop (there were over 20 people representing
        many disciplines). The workshop operated through a modified form of DORA&#8217;s

        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,

        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt

        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into their national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly publications which

        and guidelines to make scholarly publications immediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions acknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like within the framework of the European Open
        Science Cloud (EOSC), and suggest including open science monitoring in the
        European Research Area monitoring mechanism.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Die Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer Tr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu begr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote
        und -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder gemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig zu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf internationaler
        Ebene zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Daf\xFCr sind, wie das Papier richtig
        betont, abgestimmte F\xF6rderaktivit\xE4ten erforderlich, die beispielsweise
        in Deutschland, komplement\xE4r zu DEAL, dem wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizieren

        Small: Community-Owned Futures for Open Access Books\u201D</a>,</strong> April
        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q1. <strong>What drew you into studying data
        citations, sharing, and reuse?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This project combines
        two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to
        merge these interests.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q2.
        <strong>What questions or challenges were you setting out to address when
        you started this work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of our big questions
        in the project as a whole is to learn more about how researchers cite data
        in their work and for which purposes, and to think about how this varies by
        academic discipline. We started out by looking at this question bibliometrically
        in <a href=\\\"https://zenodo.org/record/4730857#.ZD9Mo-xByEs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">work</a> led by Anton with DataCite. The survey
        which we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question
        from a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em>
        they cite data (spoiler &#8211; it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a
        reference list) and <em>what </em>they actually cite (another spoiler &#8211;\_
        it isn\u2019t always a dataset) but also to learn more about <em>why</em>
        they do so.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the strengths of the survey is the
        care that we took with constructing a sample which, to the best of our efforts,
        is representative of academic authors by discipline, as represented in the
        Web of Science. This took many discussions to think about how best to do this,
        and much planning, but it also allows our findings to be stronger and perhaps
        more generalizable to the broader population.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q3.
        <strong>What motivates researchers who cite data to do so?\_</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across
        the entire sample, we found that the majority of reasons might be construed
        as motivations which reflect \u2018ideal\u2019 research practice (e.g. to
        show intellectual debt), to help others to find data, or to support the validity
        of their research claims. Few respondents indicated that external factors,
        namely being advised to do so by journals or publishers, was a motivating
        factor in their decision to cite data.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We did find
        some significant disciplinary differences to this question, though. For example,
        social science and humanities (SHH) researchers selected that they cite data
        to acknowledge intellectual debt more frequently than expected. One possible
        explanation for this could be tied to common purposes for which our SSH respondents
        reuse data (e.g. to serve as the basis for a new study or to integrate sources
        to build an argument).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q4. <strong>How do researchers prefer others
        to cite their work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Around 84% of all respondents
        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q5.
        <strong>In the survey, more than 450 respondents said that they do not reuse
        data. Why do some researchers not reuse data?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We
        asked people to self-identify as being a person who reuses data or one who
        does not. This classification itself is perhaps a bit problematic, as we know
        from <a href=\\\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2705/chapter-abstract/73133/Non-Users-Also-Matter?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past work</a> in Science
        and Technology Studies that \u2018usage\u2019 of something\u2014be that a
        car or the Internet or research data\u2014exists on a spectrum. A researcher
        may reuse data to teach a class once per year, or they may be involved in
        a years-long comparative study and be reusing data daily, or they may not
        reuse data at all.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That said, the most frequently selected
        options were that reusing data was not relevant to their research methods
        or in their research communities. Other less frequently selected reasons\u2014such
        as a lack of relevant data or difficulties finding data\u2014indicate that
        perhaps some people may have tried to reuse data previously. I bring this
        up as I think it is important to remember that this variation in practice
        exists, that not everyone is a re-user of data, and that other ways of conducting
        research are also valuable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q6.
        <strong>What are your most interesting or surprising findings?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps
        most surprising to me at a high level was how much our data had to say about
        the practices of SSH researchers. We found that SSH researchers are the only
        disciplinary groups who prefer that others cite or mention their own data,
        as opposed to other data objects (e.g. an article or a collection of data).
        This contrasts <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23529\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past scientometric work</a>
        showing that SSH scholars cite \u2018data studies,\u2019 rather than individual
        data files.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We were also able to identify unique differences
        between social scientists and humanities scholars, such as the tendency for
        humanities scholars to integrate data more than most other disciplinary groups
        or the pattern of social scientists to refer to related publications (rather
        than data) less than other groups.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\"

        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        data also show that most researchers who are citing data (in any way) report
        doing so for reasons in line with responsibly conducting research. This suggests
        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their
        communities and their own ethical principles. If this is the case, the questions
        I see which we need to consider are: When (and how) do we meet researchers
        where they are? When should their research practice be adapted to current
        technical requirements and our own recommendations for data citation, and
        when should those requirements and recommendations be adapted to reflect researchers\u2019
        actual practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\u2019s an important reminder that we
        need to take our time and involve research communities in the development
        of policies and systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>To stay up to date

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q1. <strong>What drew you into studying data
        citations, sharing, and reuse?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This project combines
        two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to
        merge these interests.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q2.
        <strong>What questions or challenges were you setting out to address when
        you started this work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of our big questions
        in the project as a whole is to learn more about how researchers cite data
        in their work and for which purposes, and to think about how this varies by
        academic discipline. We started out by looking at this question bibliometrically
        in <a href=\\\"https://zenodo.org/record/4730857#.ZD9Mo-xByEs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">work</a> led by Anton with DataCite. The survey
        which we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question
        from a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em>
        they cite data (spoiler &#8211; it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a
        reference list) and <em>what </em>they actually cite (another spoiler &#8211;\_
        it isn\u2019t always a dataset) but also to learn more about <em>why</em>
        they do so.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the strengths of the survey is the
        care that we took with constructing a sample which, to the best of our efforts,
        is representative of academic authors by discipline, as represented in the
        Web of Science. This took many discussions to think about how best to do this,
        and much planning, but it also allows our findings to be stronger and perhaps
        more generalizable to the broader population.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q3.
        <strong>What motivates researchers who cite data to do so?\_</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across
        the entire sample, we found that the majority of reasons might be construed
        as motivations which reflect \u2018ideal\u2019 research practice (e.g. to
        show intellectual debt), to help others to find data, or to support the validity
        of their research claims. Few respondents indicated that external factors,
        namely being advised to do so by journals or publishers, was a motivating
        factor in their decision to cite data.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We did find
        some significant disciplinary differences to this question, though. For example,
        social science and humanities (SHH) researchers selected that they cite data
        to acknowledge intellectual debt more frequently than expected. One possible
        explanation for this could be tied to common purposes for which our SSH respondents
        reuse data (e.g. to serve as the basis for a new study or to integrate sources
        to build an argument).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q4. <strong>How do researchers prefer others
        to cite their work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Around 84% of all respondents
        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q5.
        <strong>In the survey, more than 450 respondents said that they do not reuse
        data. Why do some researchers not reuse data?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We
        asked people to self-identify as being a person who reuses data or one who
        does not. This classification itself is perhaps a bit problematic, as we know
        from <a href=\\\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2705/chapter-abstract/73133/Non-Users-Also-Matter?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past work</a> in Science
        and Technology Studies that \u2018usage\u2019 of something\u2014be that a
        car or the Internet or research data\u2014exists on a spectrum. A researcher
        may reuse data to teach a class once per year, or they may be involved in
        a years-long comparative study and be reusing data daily, or they may not
        reuse data at all.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That said, the most frequently selected
        options were that reusing data was not relevant to their research methods
        or in their research communities. Other less frequently selected reasons\u2014such
        as a lack of relevant data or difficulties finding data\u2014indicate that
        perhaps some people may have tried to reuse data previously. I bring this
        up as I think it is important to remember that this variation in practice
        exists, that not everyone is a re-user of data, and that other ways of conducting
        research are also valuable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q6.
        <strong>What are your most interesting or surprising findings?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps
        most surprising to me at a high level was how much our data had to say about
        the practices of SSH researchers. We found that SSH researchers are the only
        disciplinary groups who prefer that others cite or mention their own data,
        as opposed to other data objects (e.g. an article or a collection of data).
        This contrasts <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23529\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past scientometric work</a>
        showing that SSH scholars cite \u2018data studies,\u2019 rather than individual
        data files.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We were also able to identify unique differences
        between social scientists and humanities scholars, such as the tendency for
        humanities scholars to integrate data more than most other disciplinary groups
        or the pattern of social scientists to refer to related publications (rather
        than data) less than other groups.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\"

        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our

        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their

        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus
        przewalskii</em></a><em> </em>was foaled on August 6th 2020 and was named
        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells
        from Willa, a black-footed female ferret who died in the 1980s and who had
        no living descendants.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image is-resized\\\"><img

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate
        functioning iPSCs from frozen cell lines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        there was clear focus on BioBanking at the GGBN conference, I was additionally
        interested to hear that GGBN standards are useful from a rewilding perspective.
        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.

        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus

        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.

        the blog&#8217;s editor &#8212; to quantify the increasing consolidation of
        the academic publishing industry. Crotty concludes:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p>Overall, the market has significantly consolidated
        since 2000 \u2014 when the top 5 publishers held 39% of the market of articles
        to 2022 where they control 61% of it. Looking at larger sets of publishers
        makes the consolidation even more extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers
        went from 47% of the market in 2000 to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest
        publishers from 54% to controlling 83% of the corpus.</p>\\n<cite>https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/10/30/quantifying-consolidation-in-the-scholarly-journals-market/</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s
        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition

        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access
        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such
        policies. The whole system rests on this logic of extraction and that&#8217;s

        post is an attempt by David Crotty &#8212; the blog&#8217;s editor &#8212;
        to quantify the increasing consolidation of the academic publishing industry.
        Crotty concludes:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p>Overall,
        the market has significantly consolidated since 2000 \u2014 when the top 5
        publishers held 39% of the market of articles to 2022 where they control 61%
        of it. Looking at larger sets of publishers makes the consolidation even more
        extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers went from 47% of the market in 2000
        to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest publishers from 54% to controlling
        83% of the corpus.</p>\\n<cite>https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/10/30/quantifying-consolidation-in-the-scholarly-journals-market/</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s
        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access

        have to be creative in order to educate about OA issues. Part of what I suspect

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im Bereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen betont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und Finanzierungsmodellen, die weder
        die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen finanziell belasten und sich durch angemessene
        und transparente Preise auszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird beklagt, dass die steigenden
        Preise f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Fachinformationen zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren
        und die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil der Forschung belasten
        (Punkt 5).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Aufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen Verlagswesen
        wird in zwei bemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung von nicht gewinnorientierten
        Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe Council
        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article
        processing charges or similar per-unit charges and stresses the importance
        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [&#8230;] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers
        are limited in their choice of publication channels due to financial capacities
        rather than quality criteria, and where access to research publications is
        restricted by paywalls\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zwar sind diese Unterstreichung
        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung
        eines pluralistischen, transparenten und nachhaltigen Systems der digtialen
        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die
        Kritik an dem Modell der Publikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Erst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den USA, als
        Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker Einrichtungen, das APC-Modell<a
        href=\\\"https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/\\\">
        deutlich kritisiert</a>. Die Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        Ungleichheit f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut ausgestatteten
        Regionen beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt werden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch hat der
        \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5\\\">R\xFCcktritt</a>
        des Editorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender
        APCs den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die zur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues Journal <a href=\\\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/\\\">gegr\xFCndet</a>,
        das niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das Problem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Um
        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,
        soll die Koordinierung innerhalb der EU und mit globalen Partnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung
        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt
        werden, um die Anzahl von not-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly
        publishing models in Europe with no costs for authors or readers&#8221; signifikant
        zu erh\xF6hen (Absatz 11).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch soll das Anliegen durch
        eine m\xF6gliche Beteiligung der EU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe
        (ORE), der von der EU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr
        Autor:innen aus den EU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        der <a href=\\\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/\\\">Pressemitteilung</a>
        werden weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen augegriffen:&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CSome
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into their national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly publications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national open access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications immediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions acknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like within the framework of the European Open
        Science Cloud (EOSC), and suggest including open science monitoring in the
        European Research Area monitoring mechanism.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Die Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer Tr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu begr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote
        und -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder gemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig zu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf internationaler
        Ebene zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Daf\xFCr sind, wie das Papier richtig
        betont, abgestimmte F\xF6rderaktivit\xE4ten erforderlich, die beispielsweise
        in Deutschland, komplement\xE4r zu DEAL, dem wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizieren
        einen deutlichen Aufschwung geben.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/kz04m-s8z58\",\"guid\":\"https://wisspub.net/?p=20455\",\"id\":\"1c578558-1324-4493-b8af-84c49eabc52f\",\"image\":\"https://wisspub.files.wordpress.com/2023/05/bildschirmc2adfoto-2023-05-23-um-11.05.39.png?w=723\",\"language\":\"de\",\"published_at\":1684833413,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"Die

        (Punkt 5).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Aufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen Verlagswesen
        wird in zwei bemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung von nicht gewinnorientierten
        Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe Council
        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article
        processing charges or similar per-unit charges and stresses the importance
        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [&#8230;] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers
        are limited in their choice of publication channels due to financial capacities
        rather than quality criteria, and where access to research publications is
        restricted by paywalls\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zwar sind diese Unterstreichung
        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung
        eines pluralistischen, transparenten und nachhaltigen Systems der digtialen
        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die
        Kritik an dem Modell der Publikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Erst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den USA, als
        Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker Einrichtungen, das APC-Modell<a
        href=\\\"https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/\\\">
        deutlich kritisiert</a>. Die Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        Ungleichheit f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut ausgestatteten
        Regionen beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt werden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch hat der
        \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5\\\">R\xFCcktritt</a>
        des Editorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender
        APCs den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die zur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues Journal <a href=\\\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/\\\">gegr\xFCndet</a>,
        das niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das Problem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Um
        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,
        soll die Koordinierung innerhalb der EU und mit globalen Partnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung
        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt
        werden, um die Anzahl von not-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly
        publishing models in Europe with no costs for authors or readers&#8221; signifikant
        zu erh\xF6hen (Absatz 11).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch soll das Anliegen durch
        eine m\xF6gliche Beteiligung der EU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe
        (ORE), der von der EU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr
        Autor:innen aus den EU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        der <a href=\\\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/\\\">Pressemitteilung</a>
        werden weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen augegriffen:&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CSome
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into their national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly publications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national open access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications immediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions acknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like within the framework of the European Open
        Science Cloud (EOSC), and suggest including open science monitoring in the
        European Research Area monitoring mechanism.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Die Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer Tr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu begr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote
        und -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder gemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig zu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf internationaler
        Ebene zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Daf\xFCr sind, wie das Papier richtig
        betont, abgestimmte F\xF6rderaktivit\xE4ten erforderlich, die beispielsweise
        in Deutschland, komplement\xE4r zu DEAL, dem wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizieren

        Small: Community-Owned Futures for Open Access Books\u201D</a>,</strong> April
        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,

        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q1. <strong>What drew you into studying data
        citations, sharing, and reuse?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This project combines
        two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to
        merge these interests.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q2.
        <strong>What questions or challenges were you setting out to address when
        you started this work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of our big questions
        in the project as a whole is to learn more about how researchers cite data
        in their work and for which purposes, and to think about how this varies by
        academic discipline. We started out by looking at this question bibliometrically
        in <a href=\\\"https://zenodo.org/record/4730857#.ZD9Mo-xByEs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">work</a> led by Anton with DataCite. The survey
        which we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question
        from a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em>
        they cite data (spoiler &#8211; it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a
        reference list) and <em>what </em>they actually cite (another spoiler &#8211;\_
        it isn\u2019t always a dataset) but also to learn more about <em>why</em>
        they do so.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the strengths of the survey is the
        care that we took with constructing a sample which, to the best of our efforts,
        is representative of academic authors by discipline, as represented in the
        Web of Science. This took many discussions to think about how best to do this,
        and much planning, but it also allows our findings to be stronger and perhaps
        more generalizable to the broader population.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q3.
        <strong>What motivates researchers who cite data to do so?\_</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across
        the entire sample, we found that the majority of reasons might be construed
        as motivations which reflect \u2018ideal\u2019 research practice (e.g. to
        show intellectual debt), to help others to find data, or to support the validity
        of their research claims. Few respondents indicated that external factors,
        namely being advised to do so by journals or publishers, was a motivating
        factor in their decision to cite data.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We did find
        some significant disciplinary differences to this question, though. For example,
        social science and humanities (SHH) researchers selected that they cite data
        to acknowledge intellectual debt more frequently than expected. One possible
        explanation for this could be tied to common purposes for which our SSH respondents
        reuse data (e.g. to serve as the basis for a new study or to integrate sources
        to build an argument).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q4. <strong>How do researchers prefer others
        to cite their work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Around 84% of all respondents
        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q5.
        <strong>In the survey, more than 450 respondents said that they do not reuse

        perhaps some people may have tried to reuse data previously. I bring this
        up as I think it is important to remember that this variation in practice

        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        data also show that most researchers who are citing data (in any way) report
        doing so for reasons in line with responsibly conducting research. This suggests
        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their
        communities and their own ethical principles. If this is the case, the questions
        I see which we need to consider are: When (and how) do we meet researchers
        where they are? When should their research practice be adapted to current
        technical requirements and our own recommendations for data citation, and
        when should those requirements and recommendations be adapted to reflect researchers\u2019
        actual practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\u2019s an important reminder that we
        need to take our time and involve research communities in the development
        of policies and systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>To stay up to date

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q1. <strong>What drew you into studying data
        citations, sharing, and reuse?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This project combines
        two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to
        merge these interests.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q2.
        <strong>What questions or challenges were you setting out to address when
        you started this work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of our big questions
        in the project as a whole is to learn more about how researchers cite data
        in their work and for which purposes, and to think about how this varies by
        academic discipline. We started out by looking at this question bibliometrically
        in <a href=\\\"https://zenodo.org/record/4730857#.ZD9Mo-xByEs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">work</a> led by Anton with DataCite. The survey
        which we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question
        from a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em>
        they cite data (spoiler &#8211; it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a
        reference list) and <em>what </em>they actually cite (another spoiler &#8211;\_
        it isn\u2019t always a dataset) but also to learn more about <em>why</em>
        they do so.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the strengths of the survey is the
        care that we took with constructing a sample which, to the best of our efforts,
        is representative of academic authors by discipline, as represented in the
        Web of Science. This took many discussions to think about how best to do this,
        and much planning, but it also allows our findings to be stronger and perhaps
        more generalizable to the broader population.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q3.
        <strong>What motivates researchers who cite data to do so?\_</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across
        the entire sample, we found that the majority of reasons might be construed
        as motivations which reflect \u2018ideal\u2019 research practice (e.g. to
        show intellectual debt), to help others to find data, or to support the validity
        of their research claims. Few respondents indicated that external factors,
        namely being advised to do so by journals or publishers, was a motivating
        factor in their decision to cite data.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We did find
        some significant disciplinary differences to this question, though. For example,
        social science and humanities (SHH) researchers selected that they cite data
        to acknowledge intellectual debt more frequently than expected. One possible
        explanation for this could be tied to common purposes for which our SSH respondents
        reuse data (e.g. to serve as the basis for a new study or to integrate sources
        to build an argument).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q4. <strong>How do researchers prefer others
        to cite their work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Around 84% of all respondents
        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q5.
        <strong>In the survey, more than 450 respondents said that they do not reuse
        data. Why do some researchers not reuse data?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We
        asked people to self-identify as being a person who reuses data or one who
        does not. This classification itself is perhaps a bit problematic, as we know
        from <a href=\\\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2705/chapter-abstract/73133/Non-Users-Also-Matter?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\"

        the Global Decline in Biodiversity: The GGBN Perspective</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Oliver
        Ryder </strong>(San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance IUCN-SSC Animal Biobanking

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">standards</a>) introduced
        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN
        Secretariat hosted and supported by the National Museum of Natural History,

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus
        przewalskii</em></a><em> </em>was foaled on August 6th 2020 and was named
        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells
        from Willa, a black-footed female ferret who died in the 1980s and who had
        no living descendants.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image is-resized\\\"><img

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate
        functioning iPSCs from frozen cell lines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        toolkit, and some of the challenges for conservation.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>From Fieldwork to BioBank</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Whereas
        there was clear focus on BioBanking at the GGBN conference, I was additionally
        interested to hear that GGBN standards are useful from a rewilding perspective.
        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental
        specimen metadata is used for decision making in projects such as the <a href=\\\"https://bethkaplin.org/current-projects/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">rewilding of Akagera
        National Park</a>. In this project \u2013 which is funded by the National
        Geographic Society \u2013 eDNA sampling of sediment cores and sample surface
        sediments are combined with natural history observations, and used to understand

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.
        As Jocelyn explained, \u201Cthe heart of the Nagoya protocol is community

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">GGBN</a> is a global
        network of collections of genomic samples from across the Tree of Life, whose
        mission is to foster collaborations among biodiversity and biobanking repositories
        in order to ensure quality standards and harmonise exchange of material in
        accordance with national and international legislation and conventions. GigaScience
        Press Data Scientist Chris Armit attended the conference and reports below
        on some of the highlights.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Confronting
        the Global Decline in Biodiversity: The GGBN Perspective</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Oliver
        Ryder </strong>(San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance IUCN-SSC Animal Biobanking
        for Conservation Specialist Group, and <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1186/2047-217X-3-32\\\"

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">standards</a>) introduced
        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN
        Secretariat hosted and supported by the National Museum of Natural History,

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus
        przewalskii</em></a><em> </em>was foaled on August 6th 2020 and was named
        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells
        from Willa, a black-footed female ferret who died in the 1980s and who had
        no living descendants.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image is-resized\\\"><img

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate
        functioning iPSCs from frozen cell lines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        toolkit, and some of the challenges for conservation.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        there was clear focus on BioBanking at the GGBN conference, I was additionally
        interested to hear that GGBN standards are useful from a rewilding perspective.
        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental
        specimen metadata is used for decision making in projects such as the <a href=\\\"https://bethkaplin.org/current-projects/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">rewilding of Akagera

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.
        As Jocelyn explained, \u201Cthe heart of the Nagoya protocol is community

        makes the consolidation even more extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers
        went from 47% of the market in 2000 to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest

        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access
        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such
        policies. The whole system rests on this logic of extraction and that&#8217;s

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im Bereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen betont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und Finanzierungsmodellen, die weder
        die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen finanziell belasten und sich durch angemessene
        und transparente Preise auszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird beklagt, dass die steigenden
        Preise f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Fachinformationen zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren
        und die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil der Forschung belasten
        (Punkt 5).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Aufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen Verlagswesen
        wird in zwei bemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung von nicht gewinnorientierten
        Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe Council
        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article
        processing charges or similar per-unit charges and stresses the importance
        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [&#8230;] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers
        are limited in their choice of publication channels due to financial capacities
        rather than quality criteria, and where access to research publications is
        restricted by paywalls\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zwar sind diese Unterstreichung
        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung
        eines pluralistischen, transparenten und nachhaltigen Systems der digtialen
        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die
        Kritik an dem Modell der Publikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Erst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den USA, als
        Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker Einrichtungen, das APC-Modell<a
        href=\\\"https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/\\\">
        deutlich kritisiert</a>. Die Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        Ungleichheit f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut ausgestatteten
        Regionen beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt werden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch hat der
        \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5\\\">R\xFCcktritt</a>
        des Editorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender
        APCs den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die zur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues Journal <a href=\\\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/\\\">gegr\xFCndet</a>,
        das niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das Problem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Um
        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,
        soll die Koordinierung innerhalb der EU und mit globalen Partnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung
        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt
        werden, um die Anzahl von not-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly
        publishing models in Europe with no costs for authors or readers&#8221; signifikant
        zu erh\xF6hen (Absatz 11).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch soll das Anliegen durch
        eine m\xF6gliche Beteiligung der EU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe
        (ORE), der von der EU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr
        Autor:innen aus den EU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        der <a href=\\\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/\\\">Pressemitteilung</a>
        werden weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen augegriffen:&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CSome
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into their national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly publications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national open access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications immediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions acknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like within the framework of the European Open
        Science Cloud (EOSC), and suggest including open science monitoring in the
        European Research Area monitoring mechanism.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Die Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer Tr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu begr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote
        und -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder gemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig zu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf internationaler
        Ebene zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Daf\xFCr sind, wie das Papier richtig
        betont, abgestimmte F\xF6rderaktivit\xE4ten erforderlich, die beispielsweise
        in Deutschland, komplement\xE4r zu DEAL, dem wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizieren
        einen deutlichen Aufschwung geben.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/kz04m-s8z58\",\"guid\":\"https://wisspub.net/?p=20455\",\"id\":\"1c578558-1324-4493-b8af-84c49eabc52f\",\"image\":\"https://wisspub.files.wordpress.com/2023/05/bildschirmc2adfoto-2023-05-23-um-11.05.39.png?w=723\",\"language\":\"de\",\"published_at\":1684833413,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"Die

        betont.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In der jetzt verabschiedeten Version der Schlussfolgerungen
        die Forderung nach sofortigem Open Access f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Publikationen,
        die im Rahmen der \xF6ffentlich gef\xF6rderten Forschung entstehen, nochmals
        betont. Dieses Ziel wurde<a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2016/05/27/eu-und-g7-staaten-setzen-auf-open-science/\\\">
        bereits 2016</a> von den EU-Wissenschaftsministerien erhoben. Die Wissenschaftsminister:innen
        hatten damals einen Open-Access-Anteil von 100 % bis 2020 gefordert. Dieser
        Wert wurde bisher jedoch nicht erreicht. In Deutschland liegt der Open-Access-Anteil
        zum Beispiel bei <a href=\\\"https://open-access-monitor.de/\\\">63</a> Prozent,
        w\xE4hrend die Niederlande im Publikationsjahr 2021 einen Anteil von <a href=\\\"https://www.openaccess.nl/en/in-the-netherlands/monitor\\\">82</a>\_Prozent

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im Bereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen betont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und Finanzierungsmodellen, die weder
        die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen finanziell belasten und sich durch angemessene
        und transparente Preise auszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird beklagt, dass die steigenden
        Preise f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Fachinformationen zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren
        und die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil der Forschung belasten
        (Punkt 5).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Aufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen Verlagswesen
        wird in zwei bemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung von nicht gewinnorientierten
        Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe Council
        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article
        processing charges or similar per-unit charges and stresses the importance
        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [&#8230;] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers
        are limited in their choice of publication channels due to financial capacities
        rather than quality criteria, and where access to research publications is
        restricted by paywalls\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zwar sind diese Unterstreichung
        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung
        eines pluralistischen, transparenten und nachhaltigen Systems der digtialen
        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die
        Kritik an dem Modell der Publikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Erst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den USA, als
        Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker Einrichtungen, das APC-Modell<a
        href=\\\"https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/\\\">
        deutlich kritisiert</a>. Die Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        Ungleichheit f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut ausgestatteten
        Regionen beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt werden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch hat der
        \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5\\\">R\xFCcktritt</a>
        des Editorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender
        APCs den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die zur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues Journal <a href=\\\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/\\\">gegr\xFCndet</a>,
        das niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das Problem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Um
        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,
        soll die Koordinierung innerhalb der EU und mit globalen Partnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung
        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt
        werden, um die Anzahl von not-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly
        publishing models in Europe with no costs for authors or readers&#8221; signifikant
        zu erh\xF6hen (Absatz 11).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch soll das Anliegen durch
        eine m\xF6gliche Beteiligung der EU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe
        (ORE), der von der EU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr
        Autor:innen aus den EU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        der <a href=\\\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/\\\">Pressemitteilung</a>
        werden weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen augegriffen:&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CSome
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into their national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly publications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national open access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications immediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions acknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like within the framework of the European Open
        Science Cloud (EOSC), and suggest including open science monitoring in the
        European Research Area monitoring mechanism.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Die Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer Tr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu begr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote
        und -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder gemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig zu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf internationaler
        Ebene zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Daf\xFCr sind, wie das Papier richtig
        betont, abgestimmte F\xF6rderaktivit\xE4ten erforderlich, die beispielsweise
        in Deutschland, komplement\xE4r zu DEAL, dem wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizieren
        einen deutlichen Aufschwung geben.</p>\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/kz04m-s8z58\",\"reference\":[],\"summary\":\"Die

        Small: Community-Owned Futures for Open Access Books\u201D</a>,</strong> April
        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures

        citations, sharing, and reuse?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This project combines
        two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to

        <strong>What questions or challenges were you setting out to address when
        you started this work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of our big questions
        in the project as a whole is to learn more about how researchers cite data
        in their work and for which purposes, and to think about how this varies by
        academic discipline. We started out by looking at this question bibliometrically
        in <a href=\\\"https://zenodo.org/record/4730857#.ZD9Mo-xByEs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">work</a> led by Anton with DataCite. The survey
        which we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question
        from a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em>
        they cite data (spoiler &#8211; it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a
        reference list) and <em>what </em>they actually cite (another spoiler &#8211;\_
        it isn\u2019t always a dataset) but also to learn more about <em>why</em>
        they do so.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the strengths of the survey is the
        care that we took with constructing a sample which, to the best of our efforts,
        is representative of academic authors by discipline, as represented in the
        Web of Science. This took many discussions to think about how best to do this,
        and much planning, but it also allows our findings to be stronger and perhaps
        more generalizable to the broader population.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q3.
        <strong>What motivates researchers who cite data to do so?\_</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across
        the entire sample, we found that the majority of reasons might be construed
        as motivations which reflect \u2018ideal\u2019 research practice (e.g. to
        show intellectual debt), to help others to find data, or to support the validity
        of their research claims. Few respondents indicated that external factors,
        namely being advised to do so by journals or publishers, was a motivating
        factor in their decision to cite data.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We did find
        some significant disciplinary differences to this question, though. For example,
        social science and humanities (SHH) researchers selected that they cite data
        to acknowledge intellectual debt more frequently than expected. One possible
        explanation for this could be tied to common purposes for which our SSH respondents
        reuse data (e.g. to serve as the basis for a new study or to integrate sources
        to build an argument).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q4. <strong>How do researchers prefer others
        to cite their work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Around 84% of all respondents
        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q5.
        <strong>In the survey, more than 450 respondents said that they do not reuse
        data. Why do some researchers not reuse data?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We
        asked people to self-identify as being a person who reuses data or one who
        does not. This classification itself is perhaps a bit problematic, as we know
        from <a href=\\\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2705/chapter-abstract/73133/Non-Users-Also-Matter?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\"

        may reuse data to teach a class once per year, or they may be involved in
        a years-long comparative study and be reusing data daily, or they may not
        reuse data at all.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That said, the most frequently selected
        options were that reusing data was not relevant to their research methods
        or in their research communities. Other less frequently selected reasons\u2014such
        as a lack of relevant data or difficulties finding data\u2014indicate that
        perhaps some people may have tried to reuse data previously. I bring this
        up as I think it is important to remember that this variation in practice
        exists, that not everyone is a re-user of data, and that other ways of conducting
        research are also valuable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q6.
        <strong>What are your most interesting or surprising findings?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps
        most surprising to me at a high level was how much our data had to say about
        the practices of SSH researchers. We found that SSH researchers are the only
        disciplinary groups who prefer that others cite or mention their own data,
        as opposed to other data objects (e.g. an article or a collection of data).
        This contrasts <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23529\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past scientometric work</a>
        showing that SSH scholars cite \u2018data studies,\u2019 rather than individual
        data files.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We were also able to identify unique differences
        between social scientists and humanities scholars, such as the tendency for
        humanities scholars to integrate data more than most other disciplinary groups
        or the pattern of social scientists to refer to related publications (rather
        than data) less than other groups.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q7. <strong>Why is your study important?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        data also show that most researchers who are citing data (in any way) report
        doing so for reasons in line with responsibly conducting research. This suggests
        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their
        communities and their own ethical principles. If this is the case, the questions
        I see which we need to consider are: When (and how) do we meet researchers
        where they are? When should their research practice be adapted to current
        technical requirements and our own recommendations for data citation, and
        when should those requirements and recommendations be adapted to reflect researchers\u2019
        actual practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\u2019s an important reminder that we
        need to take our time and involve research communities in the development
        of policies and systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>To stay up to date

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q1. <strong>What drew you into studying data
        citations, sharing, and reuse?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This project combines
        two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to
        merge these interests.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q2.

        which we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question
        from a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em>
        they cite data (spoiler &#8211; it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a

        the practices of SSH researchers. We found that SSH researchers are the only
        disciplinary groups who prefer that others cite or mention their own data,
        as opposed to other data objects (e.g. an article or a collection of data).
        This contrasts <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23529\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past scientometric work</a>
        showing that SSH scholars cite \u2018data studies,\u2019 rather than individual
        data files.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We were also able to identify unique differences
        between social scientists and humanities scholars, such as the tendency for
        humanities scholars to integrate data more than most other disciplinary groups
        or the pattern of social scientists to refer to related publications (rather
        than data) less than other groups.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q7. <strong>Why is your study important?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        data also show that most researchers who are citing data (in any way) report
        doing so for reasons in line with responsibly conducting research. This suggests
        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their
        communities and their own ethical principles. If this is the case, the questions
        I see which we need to consider are: When (and how) do we meet researchers
        where they are? When should their research practice be adapted to current
        technical requirements and our own recommendations for data citation, and
        when should those requirements and recommendations be adapted to reflect researchers\u2019
        actual practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\u2019s an important reminder that we
        need to take our time and involve research communities in the development
        of policies and systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>To stay up to date

        Ryder </strong>(San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance IUCN-SSC Animal Biobanking

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">standards</a>) introduced
        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus

        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells
        from Willa, a black-footed female ferret who died in the 1980s and who had
        no living descendants.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image is-resized\\\"><img

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate
        functioning iPSCs from frozen cell lines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve

        there was clear focus on BioBanking at the GGBN conference, I was additionally
        interested to hear that GGBN standards are useful from a rewilding perspective.
        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental

        noopener\\\">Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-sharing</a> became effective
        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.
        As Jocelyn explained, \u201Cthe heart of the Nagoya protocol is community
        consent \u2013 informed consent from indigenous people\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus

        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate
        functioning iPSCs from frozen cell lines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role

        there was clear focus on BioBanking at the GGBN conference, I was additionally
        interested to hear that GGBN standards are useful from a rewilding perspective.
        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental
        specimen metadata is used for decision making in projects such as the <a href=\\\"https://bethkaplin.org/current-projects/\\\"

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.
        As Jocelyn explained, \u201Cthe heart of the Nagoya protocol is community
        consent \u2013 informed consent from indigenous people\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        makes the consolidation even more extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers
        went from 47% of the market in 2000 to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest
        publishers from 54% to controlling 83% of the corpus.</p>\\n<cite>https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/10/30/quantifying-consolidation-in-the-scholarly-journals-market/</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s
        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access
        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such
        policies. The whole system rests on this logic of extraction and that&#8217;s

        source, open data, open protocols, open access, etc. However, I&#8217;ve always
        found that it&#8217;s a struggle to get people&#8217;s interest and that we
        have to be creative in order to educate about OA issues. Part of what I suspect
        makes advocating for OA difficult is the sort of singularity that comes from
        being &#8220;just the library,&#8221; the group that&#8217;s always talking
        about it. So when this Open Science Working Group formed, I was excited about

        on open science</a> in 2022. Later they established the working group by inviting
        people to participate in a workshop (there were over 20 people representing
        many disciplines). The workshop operated through a modified form of DORA&#8217;s
        <a href=\\\"https://sfdora.org/resource/workshop-toolkit-to-introduce-the-space-rubric/\\\">SPACE
        rubric</a>, which was designed for academic institutions to use toward improving
        their policies. I think using that tool to organize such a large group of
        people toward a practical outcome was extremely beneficial. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        more meetings, discussions, and revisions the working group was able to produce
        a set of <a href=\\\"https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/id/eprint/992647/\\\">recommendations</a>
        to bolster open scholarship throughout the university. It addresses many issues,
        including existing policies, outreach, inter-institutional work, position
        principles, open education, resources, and more. Of course, this is not the
        end of the process. Among other things, next steps include focused discussions
        with department heads, administrators, and others. I imagine that getting
        to a place where open scholarship/open science is well-understood and hopefully
        a default institutional position for research and education will require ongoing
        work. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The recommendations in the report tend to be specific
        within the context of Concordia University but I felt it worthwhile to write
        about here because the process, the findings, and the recommendations may
        be of interest to others. Perhaps you would like to try something similar

        on open science</a> in 2022. Later they established the working group by inviting
        people to participate in a workshop (there were over 20 people representing
        many disciplines). The workshop operated through a modified form of DORA&#8217;s
        <a href=\\\"https://sfdora.org/resource/workshop-toolkit-to-introduce-the-space-rubric/\\\">SPACE
        rubric</a>, which was designed for academic institutions to use toward improving
        their policies. I think using that tool to organize such a large group of
        people toward a practical outcome was extremely beneficial. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        more meetings, discussions, and revisions the working group was able to produce
        a set of <a href=\\\"https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/id/eprint/992647/\\\">recommendations</a>
        to bolster open scholarship throughout the university. It addresses many issues,
        including existing policies, outreach, inter-institutional work, position
        principles, open education, resources, and more. Of course, this is not the
        end of the process. Among other things, next steps include focused discussions
        with department heads, administrators, and others. I imagine that getting
        to a place where open scholarship/open science is well-understood and hopefully
        a default institutional position for research and education will require ongoing
        work. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The recommendations in the report tend to be specific
        within the context of Concordia University but I felt it worthwhile to write
        about here because the process, the findings, and the recommendations may
        be of interest to others. Perhaps you would like to try something similar
        at your institution? The Concordia work could be one model to reflect on what
        would work well or not so well in your own context.</p>\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/pk905-p9r05\",\"reference\":[],\"summary\":\"The

        der deutschen Version</a>)\_mit den aktuellen Herausforderungen des wissenschaftlichen
        Publikationswesens befasst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bereits im Vorfeld der Sitzung
        der Wissenschaftsministerien wurden verschiedene Versionen der Erkl\xE4rung
        \xF6ffentlich diskutiert (siehe z.B.<a href=\\\"https://sciencebusiness.net/news/Universities/leaked-eu-member-states-set-out-reform-scientific-publishing\\\">
        Science Business</a> und<a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/can-eu-make-parallel-publishing-system-work\\\">
        Times Higher Education</a>). Im Kern stand die Frage, inwiefern das EU-Papier
        den Fokus auf Finanzierungs- und Gesch\xE4ftsmodelle abseits von Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        (Article Processing Charges, APCs) legt und ob sogar eine Abkehr von der Unterst\xFCtzung
        dieses Modells durch die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa betont wird.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Schweden
        hatte das Thema im Rahmen seiner EU-Ratspr\xE4sidentschaft augegriffen und
        bereits im <a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2023/02/10/eu-wissenschaftsministerien-erortern-open-science/\\\">Februar</a>
        in einem Hintergrund-Papier adressiert. Schon in diesem Briefing Paper wurde
        die Problematik steigender Preise f\xFCr die wissenschaftlichen Fachinformation
        betont.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In der jetzt verabschiedeten Version der Schlussfolgerungen
        die Forderung nach sofortigem Open Access f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Publikationen,
        die im Rahmen der \xF6ffentlich gef\xF6rderten Forschung entstehen, nochmals
        betont. Dieses Ziel wurde<a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2016/05/27/eu-und-g7-staaten-setzen-auf-open-science/\\\">
        bereits 2016</a> von den EU-Wissenschaftsministerien erhoben. Die Wissenschaftsminister:innen
        hatten damals einen Open-Access-Anteil von 100 % bis 2020 gefordert. Dieser
        Wert wurde bisher jedoch nicht erreicht. In Deutschland liegt der Open-Access-Anteil
        zum Beispiel bei <a href=\\\"https://open-access-monitor.de/\\\">63</a> Prozent,
        w\xE4hrend die Niederlande im Publikationsjahr 2021 einen Anteil von <a href=\\\"https://www.openaccess.nl/en/in-the-netherlands/monitor\\\">82</a>\_Prozent

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im Bereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen betont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und Finanzierungsmodellen, die weder
        die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen finanziell belasten und sich durch angemessene
        und transparente Preise auszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird beklagt, dass die steigenden
        Preise f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Fachinformationen zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren
        und die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil der Forschung belasten
        (Punkt 5).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Aufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen Verlagswesen
        wird in zwei bemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung von nicht gewinnorientierten
        Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe Council
        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article
        processing charges or similar per-unit charges and stresses the importance
        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [&#8230;] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers
        are limited in their choice of publication channels due to financial capacities
        rather than quality criteria, and where access to research publications is
        restricted by paywalls\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zwar sind diese Unterstreichung
        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung
        eines pluralistischen, transparenten und nachhaltigen Systems der digtialen
        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die
        Kritik an dem Modell der Publikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Erst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den USA, als
        Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker Einrichtungen, das APC-Modell<a
        href=\\\"https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/\\\">
        deutlich kritisiert</a>. Die Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        Ungleichheit f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut ausgestatteten
        Regionen beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt werden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch hat der
        \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5\\\">R\xFCcktritt</a>
        des Editorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender
        APCs den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die zur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues Journal <a href=\\\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/\\\">gegr\xFCndet</a>,
        das niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das Problem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Um
        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,
        soll die Koordinierung innerhalb der EU und mit globalen Partnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung
        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt
        werden, um die Anzahl von not-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly
        publishing models in Europe with no costs for authors or readers&#8221; signifikant
        zu erh\xF6hen (Absatz 11).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch soll das Anliegen durch
        eine m\xF6gliche Beteiligung der EU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe
        (ORE), der von der EU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr

        der deutschen Version</a>)\_mit den aktuellen Herausforderungen des wissenschaftlichen
        Publikationswesens befasst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bereits im Vorfeld der Sitzung
        der Wissenschaftsministerien wurden verschiedene Versionen der Erkl\xE4rung
        \xF6ffentlich diskutiert (siehe z.B.<a href=\\\"https://sciencebusiness.net/news/Universities/leaked-eu-member-states-set-out-reform-scientific-publishing\\\">
        Science Business</a> und<a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/can-eu-make-parallel-publishing-system-work\\\">
        Times Higher Education</a>). Im Kern stand die Frage, inwiefern das EU-Papier
        den Fokus auf Finanzierungs- und Gesch\xE4ftsmodelle abseits von Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        (Article Processing Charges, APCs) legt und ob sogar eine Abkehr von der Unterst\xFCtzung
        dieses Modells durch die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa betont wird.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Schweden
        hatte das Thema im Rahmen seiner EU-Ratspr\xE4sidentschaft augegriffen und
        bereits im <a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2023/02/10/eu-wissenschaftsministerien-erortern-open-science/\\\">Februar</a>
        in einem Hintergrund-Papier adressiert. Schon in diesem Briefing Paper wurde
        die Problematik steigender Preise f\xFCr die wissenschaftlichen Fachinformation
        betont.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In der jetzt verabschiedeten Version der Schlussfolgerungen
        die Forderung nach sofortigem Open Access f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Publikationen,
        die im Rahmen der \xF6ffentlich gef\xF6rderten Forschung entstehen, nochmals
        betont. Dieses Ziel wurde<a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2016/05/27/eu-und-g7-staaten-setzen-auf-open-science/\\\">
        bereits 2016</a> von den EU-Wissenschaftsministerien erhoben. Die Wissenschaftsminister:innen
        hatten damals einen Open-Access-Anteil von 100 % bis 2020 gefordert. Dieser
        Wert wurde bisher jedoch nicht erreicht. In Deutschland liegt der Open-Access-Anteil
        zum Beispiel bei <a href=\\\"https://open-access-monitor.de/\\\">63</a> Prozent,
        w\xE4hrend die Niederlande im Publikationsjahr 2021 einen Anteil von <a href=\\\"https://www.openaccess.nl/en/in-the-netherlands/monitor\\\">82</a>\_Prozent

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im Bereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen betont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und Finanzierungsmodellen, die weder
        die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen finanziell belasten und sich durch angemessene
        und transparente Preise auszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird beklagt, dass die steigenden
        Preise f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Fachinformationen zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren
        und die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil der Forschung belasten
        (Punkt 5).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Aufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen Verlagswesen
        wird in zwei bemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung von nicht gewinnorientierten
        Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe Council
        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article
        processing charges or similar per-unit charges and stresses the importance
        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [&#8230;] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers
        are limited in their choice of publication channels due to financial capacities
        rather than quality criteria, and where access to research publications is
        restricted by paywalls\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zwar sind diese Unterstreichung
        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung
        eines pluralistischen, transparenten und nachhaltigen Systems der digtialen
        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die
        Kritik an dem Modell der Publikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Erst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den USA, als
        Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker Einrichtungen, das APC-Modell<a
        href=\\\"https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/\\\">
        deutlich kritisiert</a>. Die Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        Ungleichheit f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut ausgestatteten
        Regionen beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt werden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch hat der
        \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5\\\">R\xFCcktritt</a>
        des Editorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender
        APCs den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die zur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues Journal <a href=\\\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/\\\">gegr\xFCndet</a>,
        das niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das Problem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Um
        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,
        soll die Koordinierung innerhalb der EU und mit globalen Partnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung
        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt
        werden, um die Anzahl von not-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly
        publishing models in Europe with no costs for authors or readers&#8221; signifikant
        zu erh\xF6hen (Absatz 11).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch soll das Anliegen durch
        eine m\xF6gliche Beteiligung der EU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe
        (ORE), der von der EU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr
        Autor:innen aus den EU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In

        Small: Community-Owned Futures for Open Access Books\u201D</a>,</strong> April
        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q1. <strong>What drew you into studying data
        citations, sharing, and reuse?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This project combines
        two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to
        merge these interests.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q2.
        <strong>What questions or challenges were you setting out to address when
        you started this work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of our big questions
        in the project as a whole is to learn more about how researchers cite data
        in their work and for which purposes, and to think about how this varies by
        academic discipline. We started out by looking at this question bibliometrically
        in <a href=\\\"https://zenodo.org/record/4730857#.ZD9Mo-xByEs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">work</a> led by Anton with DataCite. The survey
        which we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question
        from a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em>
        they cite data (spoiler &#8211; it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a
        reference list) and <em>what </em>they actually cite (another spoiler &#8211;\_
        it isn\u2019t always a dataset) but also to learn more about <em>why</em>
        they do so.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the strengths of the survey is the
        care that we took with constructing a sample which, to the best of our efforts,
        is representative of academic authors by discipline, as represented in the
        Web of Science. This took many discussions to think about how best to do this,
        and much planning, but it also allows our findings to be stronger and perhaps
        more generalizable to the broader population.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q3.
        <strong>What motivates researchers who cite data to do so?\_</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across
        the entire sample, we found that the majority of reasons might be construed
        as motivations which reflect \u2018ideal\u2019 research practice (e.g. to
        show intellectual debt), to help others to find data, or to support the validity
        of their research claims. Few respondents indicated that external factors,
        namely being advised to do so by journals or publishers, was a motivating
        factor in their decision to cite data.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We did find
        some significant disciplinary differences to this question, though. For example,
        social science and humanities (SHH) researchers selected that they cite data
        to acknowledge intellectual debt more frequently than expected. One possible
        explanation for this could be tied to common purposes for which our SSH respondents
        reuse data (e.g. to serve as the basis for a new study or to integrate sources
        to build an argument).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q4. <strong>How do researchers prefer others
        to cite their work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Around 84% of all respondents
        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q5.
        <strong>In the survey, more than 450 respondents said that they do not reuse
        data. Why do some researchers not reuse data?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We
        asked people to self-identify as being a person who reuses data or one who
        does not. This classification itself is perhaps a bit problematic, as we know
        from <a href=\\\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2705/chapter-abstract/73133/Non-Users-Also-Matter?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past work</a> in Science
        and Technology Studies that \u2018usage\u2019 of something\u2014be that a
        car or the Internet or research data\u2014exists on a spectrum. A researcher
        may reuse data to teach a class once per year, or they may be involved in
        a years-long comparative study and be reusing data daily, or they may not
        reuse data at all.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That said, the most frequently selected
        options were that reusing data was not relevant to their research methods
        or in their research communities. Other less frequently selected reasons\u2014such
        as a lack of relevant data or difficulties finding data\u2014indicate that
        perhaps some people may have tried to reuse data previously. I bring this
        up as I think it is important to remember that this variation in practice
        exists, that not everyone is a re-user of data, and that other ways of conducting
        research are also valuable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q6.
        <strong>What are your most interesting or surprising findings?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps
        most surprising to me at a high level was how much our data had to say about
        the practices of SSH researchers. We found that SSH researchers are the only
        disciplinary groups who prefer that others cite or mention their own data,
        as opposed to other data objects (e.g. an article or a collection of data).
        This contrasts <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23529\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past scientometric work</a>
        showing that SSH scholars cite \u2018data studies,\u2019 rather than individual
        data files.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We were also able to identify unique differences
        between social scientists and humanities scholars, such as the tendency for
        humanities scholars to integrate data more than most other disciplinary groups
        or the pattern of social scientists to refer to related publications (rather
        than data) less than other groups.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q7. <strong>Why is your study important?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        data also show that most researchers who are citing data (in any way) report
        doing so for reasons in line with responsibly conducting research. This suggests
        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their
        communities and their own ethical principles. If this is the case, the questions
        I see which we need to consider are: When (and how) do we meet researchers
        where they are? When should their research practice be adapted to current
        technical requirements and our own recommendations for data citation, and
        when should those requirements and recommendations be adapted to reflect researchers\u2019
        actual practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\u2019s an important reminder that we
        need to take our time and involve research communities in the development
        of policies and systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>To stay up to date

        <strong>What motivates researchers who cite data to do so?\_</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across
        the entire sample, we found that the majority of reasons might be construed
        as motivations which reflect \u2018ideal\u2019 research practice (e.g. to
        show intellectual debt), to help others to find data, or to support the validity
        of their research claims. Few respondents indicated that external factors,
        namely being advised to do so by journals or publishers, was a motivating
        factor in their decision to cite data.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We did find
        some significant disciplinary differences to this question, though. For example,
        social science and humanities (SHH) researchers selected that they cite data
        to acknowledge intellectual debt more frequently than expected. One possible
        explanation for this could be tied to common purposes for which our SSH respondents
        reuse data (e.g. to serve as the basis for a new study or to integrate sources
        to build an argument).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q4. <strong>How do researchers prefer others
        to cite their work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Around 84% of all respondents
        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q5.
        <strong>In the survey, more than 450 respondents said that they do not reuse
        data. Why do some researchers not reuse data?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We
        asked people to self-identify as being a person who reuses data or one who
        does not. This classification itself is perhaps a bit problematic, as we know
        from <a href=\\\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2705/chapter-abstract/73133/Non-Users-Also-Matter?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past work</a> in Science
        and Technology Studies that \u2018usage\u2019 of something\u2014be that a
        car or the Internet or research data\u2014exists on a spectrum. A researcher
        may reuse data to teach a class once per year, or they may be involved in
        a years-long comparative study and be reusing data daily, or they may not
        reuse data at all.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That said, the most frequently selected
        options were that reusing data was not relevant to their research methods
        or in their research communities. Other less frequently selected reasons\u2014such
        as a lack of relevant data or difficulties finding data\u2014indicate that
        perhaps some people may have tried to reuse data previously. I bring this
        up as I think it is important to remember that this variation in practice
        exists, that not everyone is a re-user of data, and that other ways of conducting
        research are also valuable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q6.
        <strong>What are your most interesting or surprising findings?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps
        most surprising to me at a high level was how much our data had to say about
        the practices of SSH researchers. We found that SSH researchers are the only
        disciplinary groups who prefer that others cite or mention their own data,
        as opposed to other data objects (e.g. an article or a collection of data).
        This contrasts <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23529\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past scientometric work</a>
        showing that SSH scholars cite \u2018data studies,\u2019 rather than individual
        data files.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We were also able to identify unique differences
        between social scientists and humanities scholars, such as the tendency for
        humanities scholars to integrate data more than most other disciplinary groups
        or the pattern of social scientists to refer to related publications (rather
        than data) less than other groups.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q7. <strong>Why is your study important?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        data also show that most researchers who are citing data (in any way) report
        doing so for reasons in line with responsibly conducting research. This suggests
        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their
        communities and their own ethical principles. If this is the case, the questions
        I see which we need to consider are: When (and how) do we meet researchers
        where they are? When should their research practice be adapted to current
        technical requirements and our own recommendations for data citation, and
        when should those requirements and recommendations be adapted to reflect researchers\u2019
        actual practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\u2019s an important reminder that we
        need to take our time and involve research communities in the development
        of policies and systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>To stay up to date

        Ryder </strong>(San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance IUCN-SSC Animal Biobanking

        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus

        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells
        from Willa, a black-footed female ferret who died in the 1980s and who had

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate
        functioning iPSCs from frozen cell lines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the

        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.

        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation

        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the

        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks

        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus

        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity

        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate
        functioning iPSCs from frozen cell lines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural

        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.

        makes the consolidation even more extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers
        went from 47% of the market in 2000 to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest

        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access
        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such

        processes and supports within an institution can, I&#8217;ve noticed, demand
        a bit of effort to change. When we speak of <strong>open scholarship</strong>
        or <strong>open science</strong>, many aspects tie-in or lead out from those
        concepts, which makes the whole prospect of institutional change quite complex.
        I&#8217;m very excited about the efforts so far that the Open Science Working
        Group (of which I&#8217;m a participant) at Concordia University has undertaken
        and accomplished. These include an initial report on &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.11573/spectrum.library.concordia.ca.00992647\\\"><strong>Recommendations

        course, the Library is always doing outreach about open access (OA). In the

        access week</a>. I can see how frequently our modern research practices, which
        involve digital techniques are enabled by the various forms of open: open
        source, open data, open protocols, open access, etc. However, I&#8217;ve always
        found that it&#8217;s a struggle to get people&#8217;s interest and that we
        have to be creative in order to educate about OA issues. Part of what I suspect
        makes advocating for OA difficult is the sort of singularity that comes from

        involve digital techniques are enabled by the various forms of open: open
        source, open data, open protocols, open access, etc. However, I&#8217;ve always
        found that it&#8217;s a struggle to get people&#8217;s interest and that we
        have to be creative in order to educate about OA issues. Part of what I suspect
        makes advocating for OA difficult is the sort of singularity that comes from

        der deutschen Version</a>)\_mit den aktuellen Herausforderungen des wissenschaftlichen
        Publikationswesens befasst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bereits im Vorfeld der Sitzung
        der Wissenschaftsministerien wurden verschiedene Versionen der Erkl\xE4rung
        \xF6ffentlich diskutiert (siehe z.B.<a href=\\\"https://sciencebusiness.net/news/Universities/leaked-eu-member-states-set-out-reform-scientific-publishing\\\">
        Science Business</a> und<a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/can-eu-make-parallel-publishing-system-work\\\">
        Times Higher Education</a>). Im Kern stand die Frage, inwiefern das EU-Papier
        den Fokus auf Finanzierungs- und Gesch\xE4ftsmodelle abseits von Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        (Article Processing Charges, APCs) legt und ob sogar eine Abkehr von der Unterst\xFCtzung
        dieses Modells durch die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa betont wird.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Schweden
        hatte das Thema im Rahmen seiner EU-Ratspr\xE4sidentschaft augegriffen und
        bereits im <a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2023/02/10/eu-wissenschaftsministerien-erortern-open-science/\\\">Februar</a>
        in einem Hintergrund-Papier adressiert. Schon in diesem Briefing Paper wurde
        die Problematik steigender Preise f\xFCr die wissenschaftlichen Fachinformation
        betont.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In der jetzt verabschiedeten Version der Schlussfolgerungen
        die Forderung nach sofortigem Open Access f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Publikationen,
        die im Rahmen der \xF6ffentlich gef\xF6rderten Forschung entstehen, nochmals
        betont. Dieses Ziel wurde<a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2016/05/27/eu-und-g7-staaten-setzen-auf-open-science/\\\">
        bereits 2016</a> von den EU-Wissenschaftsministerien erhoben. Die Wissenschaftsminister:innen
        hatten damals einen Open-Access-Anteil von 100 % bis 2020 gefordert. Dieser
        Wert wurde bisher jedoch nicht erreicht. In Deutschland liegt der Open-Access-Anteil
        zum Beispiel bei <a href=\\\"https://open-access-monitor.de/\\\">63</a> Prozent,
        w\xE4hrend die Niederlande im Publikationsjahr 2021 einen Anteil von <a href=\\\"https://www.openaccess.nl/en/in-the-netherlands/monitor\\\">82</a>\_Prozent

        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article

        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [&#8230;] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers

        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die

        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt

        der Wissenschaftsministerien wurden verschiedene Versionen der Erkl\xE4rung
        \xF6ffentlich diskutiert (siehe z.B.<a href=\\\"https://sciencebusiness.net/news/Universities/leaked-eu-member-states-set-out-reform-scientific-publishing\\\">
        Science Business</a> und<a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/can-eu-make-parallel-publishing-system-work\\\">
        Times Higher Education</a>). Im Kern stand die Frage, inwiefern das EU-Papier
        den Fokus auf Finanzierungs- und Gesch\xE4ftsmodelle abseits von Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        (Article Processing Charges, APCs) legt und ob sogar eine Abkehr von der Unterst\xFCtzung
        dieses Modells durch die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa betont wird.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Schweden
        hatte das Thema im Rahmen seiner EU-Ratspr\xE4sidentschaft augegriffen und
        bereits im <a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2023/02/10/eu-wissenschaftsministerien-erortern-open-science/\\\">Februar</a>
        in einem Hintergrund-Papier adressiert. Schon in diesem Briefing Paper wurde
        die Problematik steigender Preise f\xFCr die wissenschaftlichen Fachinformation
        betont.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In der jetzt verabschiedeten Version der Schlussfolgerungen
        die Forderung nach sofortigem Open Access f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Publikationen,
        die im Rahmen der \xF6ffentlich gef\xF6rderten Forschung entstehen, nochmals
        betont. Dieses Ziel wurde<a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2016/05/27/eu-und-g7-staaten-setzen-auf-open-science/\\\">
        bereits 2016</a> von den EU-Wissenschaftsministerien erhoben. Die Wissenschaftsminister:innen
        hatten damals einen Open-Access-Anteil von 100 % bis 2020 gefordert. Dieser
        Wert wurde bisher jedoch nicht erreicht. In Deutschland liegt der Open-Access-Anteil
        zum Beispiel bei <a href=\\\"https://open-access-monitor.de/\\\">63</a> Prozent,
        w\xE4hrend die Niederlande im Publikationsjahr 2021 einen Anteil von <a href=\\\"https://www.openaccess.nl/en/in-the-netherlands/monitor\\\">82</a>\_Prozent

        Small: Community-Owned Futures for Open Access Books\u201D</a>,</strong> April
        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q1. <strong>What drew you into studying data
        citations, sharing, and reuse?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This project combines
        two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to
        merge these interests.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q2.
        <strong>What questions or challenges were you setting out to address when
        you started this work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of our big questions
        in the project as a whole is to learn more about how researchers cite data
        in their work and for which purposes, and to think about how this varies by
        academic discipline. We started out by looking at this question bibliometrically
        in <a href=\\\"https://zenodo.org/record/4730857#.ZD9Mo-xByEs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">work</a> led by Anton with DataCite. The survey
        which we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question
        from a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em>
        they cite data (spoiler &#8211; it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a
        reference list) and <em>what </em>they actually cite (another spoiler &#8211;\_
        it isn\u2019t always a dataset) but also to learn more about <em>why</em>
        they do so.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the strengths of the survey is the
        care that we took with constructing a sample which, to the best of our efforts,
        is representative of academic authors by discipline, as represented in the
        Web of Science. This took many discussions to think about how best to do this,
        and much planning, but it also allows our findings to be stronger and perhaps
        more generalizable to the broader population.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q3.
        <strong>What motivates researchers who cite data to do so?\_</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across
        the entire sample, we found that the majority of reasons might be construed
        as motivations which reflect \u2018ideal\u2019 research practice (e.g. to
        show intellectual debt), to help others to find data, or to support the validity
        of their research claims. Few respondents indicated that external factors,
        namely being advised to do so by journals or publishers, was a motivating
        factor in their decision to cite data.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We did find
        some significant disciplinary differences to this question, though. For example,
        social science and humanities (SHH) researchers selected that they cite data
        to acknowledge intellectual debt more frequently than expected. One possible
        explanation for this could be tied to common purposes for which our SSH respondents
        reuse data (e.g. to serve as the basis for a new study or to integrate sources
        to build an argument).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q4. <strong>How do researchers prefer others
        to cite their work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Around 84% of all respondents
        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q5.
        <strong>In the survey, more than 450 respondents said that they do not reuse
        data. Why do some researchers not reuse data?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We
        asked people to self-identify as being a person who reuses data or one who
        does not. This classification itself is perhaps a bit problematic, as we know
        from <a href=\\\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2705/chapter-abstract/73133/Non-Users-Also-Matter?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past work</a> in Science
        and Technology Studies that \u2018usage\u2019 of something\u2014be that a
        car or the Internet or research data\u2014exists on a spectrum. A researcher
        may reuse data to teach a class once per year, or they may be involved in
        a years-long comparative study and be reusing data daily, or they may not
        reuse data at all.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That said, the most frequently selected
        options were that reusing data was not relevant to their research methods
        or in their research communities. Other less frequently selected reasons\u2014such
        as a lack of relevant data or difficulties finding data\u2014indicate that
        perhaps some people may have tried to reuse data previously. I bring this
        up as I think it is important to remember that this variation in practice
        exists, that not everyone is a re-user of data, and that other ways of conducting
        research are also valuable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q6.
        <strong>What are your most interesting or surprising findings?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps
        most surprising to me at a high level was how much our data had to say about
        the practices of SSH researchers. We found that SSH researchers are the only
        disciplinary groups who prefer that others cite or mention their own data,
        as opposed to other data objects (e.g. an article or a collection of data).
        This contrasts <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23529\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past scientometric work</a>
        showing that SSH scholars cite \u2018data studies,\u2019 rather than individual
        data files.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We were also able to identify unique differences
        between social scientists and humanities scholars, such as the tendency for
        humanities scholars to integrate data more than most other disciplinary groups
        or the pattern of social scientists to refer to related publications (rather
        than data) less than other groups.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q7. <strong>Why is your study important?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        data also show that most researchers who are citing data (in any way) report
        doing so for reasons in line with responsibly conducting research. This suggests
        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their
        communities and their own ethical principles. If this is the case, the questions
        I see which we need to consider are: When (and how) do we meet researchers
        where they are? When should their research practice be adapted to current
        technical requirements and our own recommendations for data citation, and
        when should those requirements and recommendations be adapted to reflect researchers\u2019
        actual practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\u2019s an important reminder that we
        need to take our time and involve research communities in the development
        of policies and systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>To stay up to date

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q1. <strong>What drew you into studying data
        citations, sharing, and reuse?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This project combines
        two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to
        merge these interests.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q2.
        <strong>What questions or challenges were you setting out to address when
        you started this work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of our big questions
        in the project as a whole is to learn more about how researchers cite data
        in their work and for which purposes, and to think about how this varies by
        academic discipline. We started out by looking at this question bibliometrically
        in <a href=\\\"https://zenodo.org/record/4730857#.ZD9Mo-xByEs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">work</a> led by Anton with DataCite. The survey
        which we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question
        from a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em>
        they cite data (spoiler &#8211; it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a
        reference list) and <em>what </em>they actually cite (another spoiler &#8211;\_
        it isn\u2019t always a dataset) but also to learn more about <em>why</em>
        they do so.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the strengths of the survey is the
        care that we took with constructing a sample which, to the best of our efforts,
        is representative of academic authors by discipline, as represented in the
        Web of Science. This took many discussions to think about how best to do this,
        and much planning, but it also allows our findings to be stronger and perhaps
        more generalizable to the broader population.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q3.
        <strong>What motivates researchers who cite data to do so?\_</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across
        the entire sample, we found that the majority of reasons might be construed
        as motivations which reflect \u2018ideal\u2019 research practice (e.g. to
        show intellectual debt), to help others to find data, or to support the validity
        of their research claims. Few respondents indicated that external factors,
        namely being advised to do so by journals or publishers, was a motivating
        factor in their decision to cite data.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We did find
        some significant disciplinary differences to this question, though. For example,
        social science and humanities (SHH) researchers selected that they cite data
        to acknowledge intellectual debt more frequently than expected. One possible
        explanation for this could be tied to common purposes for which our SSH respondents
        reuse data (e.g. to serve as the basis for a new study or to integrate sources
        to build an argument).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q4. <strong>How do researchers prefer others
        to cite their work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Around 84% of all respondents
        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q5.
        <strong>In the survey, more than 450 respondents said that they do not reuse
        data. Why do some researchers not reuse data?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We
        asked people to self-identify as being a person who reuses data or one who
        does not. This classification itself is perhaps a bit problematic, as we know
        from <a href=\\\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2705/chapter-abstract/73133/Non-Users-Also-Matter?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past work</a> in Science
        and Technology Studies that \u2018usage\u2019 of something\u2014be that a
        car or the Internet or research data\u2014exists on a spectrum. A researcher
        may reuse data to teach a class once per year, or they may be involved in
        a years-long comparative study and be reusing data daily, or they may not
        reuse data at all.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That said, the most frequently selected
        options were that reusing data was not relevant to their research methods
        or in their research communities. Other less frequently selected reasons\u2014such
        as a lack of relevant data or difficulties finding data\u2014indicate that
        perhaps some people may have tried to reuse data previously. I bring this
        up as I think it is important to remember that this variation in practice
        exists, that not everyone is a re-user of data, and that other ways of conducting
        research are also valuable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q6.
        <strong>What are your most interesting or surprising findings?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps
        most surprising to me at a high level was how much our data had to say about
        the practices of SSH researchers. We found that SSH researchers are the only
        disciplinary groups who prefer that others cite or mention their own data,
        as opposed to other data objects (e.g. an article or a collection of data).
        This contrasts <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23529\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past scientometric work</a>
        showing that SSH scholars cite \u2018data studies,\u2019 rather than individual
        data files.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We were also able to identify unique differences
        between social scientists and humanities scholars, such as the tendency for
        humanities scholars to integrate data more than most other disciplinary groups
        or the pattern of social scientists to refer to related publications (rather
        than data) less than other groups.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q7. <strong>Why is your study important?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        data also show that most researchers who are citing data (in any way) report
        doing so for reasons in line with responsibly conducting research. This suggests
        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their
        communities and their own ethical principles. If this is the case, the questions
        I see which we need to consider are: When (and how) do we meet researchers
        where they are? When should their research practice be adapted to current
        technical requirements and our own recommendations for data citation, and
        when should those requirements and recommendations be adapted to reflect researchers\u2019
        actual practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\u2019s an important reminder that we
        need to take our time and involve research communities in the development
        of policies and systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>To stay up to date

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus

        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells

        no living descendants.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image is-resized\\\"><img

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate
        functioning iPSCs from frozen cell lines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        there was clear focus on BioBanking at the GGBN conference, I was additionally
        interested to hear that GGBN standards are useful from a rewilding perspective.
        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.
        As Jocelyn explained, \u201Cthe heart of the Nagoya protocol is community

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"

        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the

        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural

        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.

        <em>Scholarly Kitchen </em>blog post is an attempt by David Crotty &#8212;
        the blog&#8217;s editor &#8212; to quantify the increasing consolidation of
        the academic publishing industry. Crotty concludes:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p>Overall, the market has significantly consolidated
        since 2000 \u2014 when the top 5 publishers held 39% of the market of articles
        to 2022 where they control 61% of it. Looking at larger sets of publishers
        makes the consolidation even more extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers
        went from 47% of the market in 2000 to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest
        publishers from 54% to controlling 83% of the corpus.</p>\\n<cite>https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/10/30/quantifying-consolidation-in-the-scholarly-journals-market/</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s
        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access
        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking

        post is an attempt by David Crotty &#8212; the blog&#8217;s editor &#8212;
        to quantify the increasing consolidation of the academic publishing industry.
        Crotty concludes:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p>Overall,
        the market has significantly consolidated since 2000 \u2014 when the top 5
        publishers held 39% of the market of articles to 2022 where they control 61%
        of it. Looking at larger sets of publishers makes the consolidation even more
        extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers went from 47% of the market in 2000
        to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest publishers from 54% to controlling
        83% of the corpus.</p>\\n<cite>https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/10/30/quantifying-consolidation-in-the-scholarly-journals-market/</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s
        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access
        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such
        policies. The whole system rests on this logic of extraction and that&#8217;s
        what needs to be opposed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/z8017-00204\",\"reference\":[],\"summary\":\"Today\u2019s

        found that it&#8217;s a struggle to get people&#8217;s interest and that we
        have to be creative in order to educate about OA issues. Part of what I suspect
        makes advocating for OA difficult is the sort of singularity that comes from
        being &#8220;just the library,&#8221; the group that&#8217;s always talking

        und die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil der Forschung belasten
        (Punkt 5).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Aufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen Verlagswesen
        wird in zwei bemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung von nicht gewinnorientierten
        Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe Council
        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article
        processing charges or similar per-unit charges and stresses the importance
        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [&#8230;] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers
        are limited in their choice of publication channels due to financial capacities
        rather than quality criteria, and where access to research publications is
        restricted by paywalls\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zwar sind diese Unterstreichung
        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung
        eines pluralistischen, transparenten und nachhaltigen Systems der digtialen
        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die
        Kritik an dem Modell der Publikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Erst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den USA, als
        Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker Einrichtungen, das APC-Modell<a
        href=\\\"https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/\\\">
        deutlich kritisiert</a>. Die Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        Ungleichheit f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut ausgestatteten
        Regionen beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt werden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch hat der
        \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5\\\">R\xFCcktritt</a>
        des Editorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender
        APCs den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die zur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues Journal <a href=\\\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/\\\">gegr\xFCndet</a>,
        das niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das Problem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Um
        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,
        soll die Koordinierung innerhalb der EU und mit globalen Partnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung
        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt
        werden, um die Anzahl von not-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly
        publishing models in Europe with no costs for authors or readers&#8221; signifikant
        zu erh\xF6hen (Absatz 11).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch soll das Anliegen durch
        eine m\xF6gliche Beteiligung der EU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe
        (ORE), der von der EU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr
        Autor:innen aus den EU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        der <a href=\\\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/\\\">Pressemitteilung</a>
        werden weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen augegriffen:&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CSome
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into their national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly publications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national open access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications immediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions acknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like within the framework of the European Open
        Science Cloud (EOSC), and suggest including open science monitoring in the
        European Research Area monitoring mechanism.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Die Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer Tr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu begr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote
        und -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder gemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig zu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf internationaler
        Ebene zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Daf\xFCr sind, wie das Papier richtig
        betont, abgestimmte F\xF6rderaktivit\xE4ten erforderlich, die beispielsweise
        in Deutschland, komplement\xE4r zu DEAL, dem wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizieren
        einen deutlichen Aufschwung geben.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/kz04m-s8z58\",\"guid\":\"https://wisspub.net/?p=20455\",\"id\":\"1c578558-1324-4493-b8af-84c49eabc52f\",\"image\":\"https://wisspub.files.wordpress.com/2023/05/bildschirmc2adfoto-2023-05-23-um-11.05.39.png?w=723\",\"language\":\"de\",\"published_at\":1684833413,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"Die

        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into their national

        and guidelines to make scholarly publications immediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions acknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like within the framework of the European Open

        European Research Area monitoring mechanism.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Die Schlussfolgerungen

        Small: Community-Owned Futures for Open Access Books\u201D</a>,</strong> April
        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q1. <strong>What drew you into studying data
        citations, sharing, and reuse?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This project combines
        two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to
        merge these interests.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q2.
        <strong>What questions or challenges were you setting out to address when
        you started this work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of our big questions
        in the project as a whole is to learn more about how researchers cite data
        in their work and for which purposes, and to think about how this varies by
        academic discipline. We started out by looking at this question bibliometrically
        in <a href=\\\"https://zenodo.org/record/4730857#.ZD9Mo-xByEs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">work</a> led by Anton with DataCite. The survey
        which we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question
        from a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em>
        they cite data (spoiler &#8211; it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a
        reference list) and <em>what </em>they actually cite (another spoiler &#8211;\_
        it isn\u2019t always a dataset) but also to learn more about <em>why</em>
        they do so.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the strengths of the survey is the
        care that we took with constructing a sample which, to the best of our efforts,
        is representative of academic authors by discipline, as represented in the
        Web of Science. This took many discussions to think about how best to do this,
        and much planning, but it also allows our findings to be stronger and perhaps
        more generalizable to the broader population.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q3.
        <strong>What motivates researchers who cite data to do so?\_</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across
        the entire sample, we found that the majority of reasons might be construed
        as motivations which reflect \u2018ideal\u2019 research practice (e.g. to
        show intellectual debt), to help others to find data, or to support the validity
        of their research claims. Few respondents indicated that external factors,
        namely being advised to do so by journals or publishers, was a motivating
        factor in their decision to cite data.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We did find
        some significant disciplinary differences to this question, though. For example,
        social science and humanities (SHH) researchers selected that they cite data
        to acknowledge intellectual debt more frequently than expected. One possible
        explanation for this could be tied to common purposes for which our SSH respondents
        reuse data (e.g. to serve as the basis for a new study or to integrate sources
        to build an argument).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q4. <strong>How do researchers prefer others
        to cite their work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Around 84% of all respondents
        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q5.
        <strong>In the survey, more than 450 respondents said that they do not reuse
        data. Why do some researchers not reuse data?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We
        asked people to self-identify as being a person who reuses data or one who
        does not. This classification itself is perhaps a bit problematic, as we know
        from <a href=\\\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2705/chapter-abstract/73133/Non-Users-Also-Matter?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past work</a> in Science
        and Technology Studies that \u2018usage\u2019 of something\u2014be that a
        car or the Internet or research data\u2014exists on a spectrum. A researcher
        may reuse data to teach a class once per year, or they may be involved in
        a years-long comparative study and be reusing data daily, or they may not
        reuse data at all.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That said, the most frequently selected
        options were that reusing data was not relevant to their research methods
        or in their research communities. Other less frequently selected reasons\u2014such
        as a lack of relevant data or difficulties finding data\u2014indicate that
        perhaps some people may have tried to reuse data previously. I bring this
        up as I think it is important to remember that this variation in practice
        exists, that not everyone is a re-user of data, and that other ways of conducting
        research are also valuable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q6.
        <strong>What are your most interesting or surprising findings?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps
        most surprising to me at a high level was how much our data had to say about
        the practices of SSH researchers. We found that SSH researchers are the only

        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        data also show that most researchers who are citing data (in any way) report
        doing so for reasons in line with responsibly conducting research. This suggests
        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their
        communities and their own ethical principles. If this is the case, the questions
        I see which we need to consider are: When (and how) do we meet researchers
        where they are? When should their research practice be adapted to current
        technical requirements and our own recommendations for data citation, and
        when should those requirements and recommendations be adapted to reflect researchers\u2019
        actual practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\u2019s an important reminder that we
        need to take our time and involve research communities in the development
        of policies and systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>To stay up to date

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q1. <strong>What drew you into studying data
        citations, sharing, and reuse?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This project combines
        two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to
        merge these interests.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q2.
        <strong>What questions or challenges were you setting out to address when
        you started this work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of our big questions
        in the project as a whole is to learn more about how researchers cite data
        in their work and for which purposes, and to think about how this varies by
        academic discipline. We started out by looking at this question bibliometrically
        in <a href=\\\"https://zenodo.org/record/4730857#.ZD9Mo-xByEs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">work</a> led by Anton with DataCite. The survey
        which we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question
        from a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em>
        they cite data (spoiler &#8211; it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a
        reference list) and <em>what </em>they actually cite (another spoiler &#8211;\_
        it isn\u2019t always a dataset) but also to learn more about <em>why</em>
        they do so.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the strengths of the survey is the
        care that we took with constructing a sample which, to the best of our efforts,
        is representative of academic authors by discipline, as represented in the
        Web of Science. This took many discussions to think about how best to do this,
        and much planning, but it also allows our findings to be stronger and perhaps
        more generalizable to the broader population.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q3.
        <strong>What motivates researchers who cite data to do so?\_</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across
        the entire sample, we found that the majority of reasons might be construed
        as motivations which reflect \u2018ideal\u2019 research practice (e.g. to
        show intellectual debt), to help others to find data, or to support the validity
        of their research claims. Few respondents indicated that external factors,
        namely being advised to do so by journals or publishers, was a motivating
        factor in their decision to cite data.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We did find
        some significant disciplinary differences to this question, though. For example,
        social science and humanities (SHH) researchers selected that they cite data
        to acknowledge intellectual debt more frequently than expected. One possible
        explanation for this could be tied to common purposes for which our SSH respondents
        reuse data (e.g. to serve as the basis for a new study or to integrate sources
        to build an argument).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q4. <strong>How do researchers prefer others
        to cite their work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Around 84% of all respondents
        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q5.
        <strong>In the survey, more than 450 respondents said that they do not reuse
        data. Why do some researchers not reuse data?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We
        asked people to self-identify as being a person who reuses data or one who
        does not. This classification itself is perhaps a bit problematic, as we know
        from <a href=\\\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2705/chapter-abstract/73133/Non-Users-Also-Matter?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past work</a> in Science
        and Technology Studies that \u2018usage\u2019 of something\u2014be that a
        car or the Internet or research data\u2014exists on a spectrum. A researcher
        may reuse data to teach a class once per year, or they may be involved in
        a years-long comparative study and be reusing data daily, or they may not
        reuse data at all.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That said, the most frequently selected
        options were that reusing data was not relevant to their research methods
        or in their research communities. Other less frequently selected reasons\u2014such
        as a lack of relevant data or difficulties finding data\u2014indicate that
        perhaps some people may have tried to reuse data previously. I bring this
        up as I think it is important to remember that this variation in practice
        exists, that not everyone is a re-user of data, and that other ways of conducting
        research are also valuable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q6.
        <strong>What are your most interesting or surprising findings?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps
        most surprising to me at a high level was how much our data had to say about
        the practices of SSH researchers. We found that SSH researchers are the only
        disciplinary groups who prefer that others cite or mention their own data,
        as opposed to other data objects (e.g. an article or a collection of data).
        This contrasts <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23529\\\"

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">GGBN</a> is a global
        network of collections of genomic samples from across the Tree of Life, whose
        mission is to foster collaborations among biodiversity and biobanking repositories
        in order to ensure quality standards and harmonise exchange of material in
        accordance with national and international legislation and conventions. GigaScience

        the Global Decline in Biodiversity: The GGBN Perspective</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Oliver
        Ryder </strong>(San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance IUCN-SSC Animal Biobanking

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">standards</a>) introduced
        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN
        Secretariat hosted and supported by the National Museum of Natural History,
        Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC \u2013 aims to provide the necessary

        Ryder\u2019s keynote talk set the stage for Animal Biobanking for Conservation.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus
        przewalskii</em></a><em> </em>was foaled on August 6th 2020 and was named
        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells
        from Willa, a black-footed female ferret who died in the 1980s and who had
        no living descendants.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image is-resized\\\"><img

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate
        functioning iPSCs from frozen cell lines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        toolkit, and some of the challenges for conservation.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>From Fieldwork to BioBank</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Whereas
        there was clear focus on BioBanking at the GGBN conference, I was additionally
        interested to hear that GGBN standards are useful from a rewilding perspective.
        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental
        specimen metadata is used for decision making in projects such as the <a href=\\\"https://bethkaplin.org/current-projects/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">rewilding of Akagera
        National Park</a>. In this project \u2013 which is funded by the National
        Geographic Society \u2013 eDNA sampling of sediment cores and sample surface
        sediments are combined with natural history observations, and used to understand
        biodiversity patterns and assist park management in their plan for reintroductions.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        <a href=\\\"https://www.cbd.int/abs/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\">Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-sharing</a> became effective
        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.
        As Jocelyn explained, \u201Cthe heart of the Nagoya protocol is community
        consent \u2013 informed consent from indigenous people\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        place in Aguascalientes, Mexico from October 17th to October 20th 2023 where
        it was hosted by the Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes. The <a href=\\\"https://www.ggbn.org/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">GGBN</a> is a global
        network of collections of genomic samples from across the Tree of Life, whose
        mission is to foster collaborations among biodiversity and biobanking repositories
        in order to ensure quality standards and harmonise exchange of material in
        accordance with national and international legislation and conventions. GigaScience
        Press Data Scientist Chris Armit attended the conference and reports below
        on some of the highlights.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Confronting
        the Global Decline in Biodiversity: The GGBN Perspective</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Oliver
        Ryder </strong>(San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance IUCN-SSC Animal Biobanking
        for Conservation Specialist Group, and <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1186/2047-217X-3-32\\\"

        \u2013 of which we have published many genomes and <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1186/2047-217X-1-8\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">standards</a>) introduced
        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN
        Secretariat hosted and supported by the National Museum of Natural History,
        Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC \u2013 aims to provide the necessary

        Ryder\u2019s keynote talk set the stage for Animal Biobanking for Conservation.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus
        przewalskii</em></a><em> </em>was foaled on August 6th 2020 and was named
        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells
        from Willa, a black-footed female ferret who died in the 1980s and who had
        no living descendants.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image is-resized\\\"><img

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate
        functioning iPSCs from frozen cell lines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        toolkit, and some of the challenges for conservation.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>From Fieldwork to BioBank</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Whereas
        there was clear focus on BioBanking at the GGBN conference, I was additionally
        interested to hear that GGBN standards are useful from a rewilding perspective.
        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental
        specimen metadata is used for decision making in projects such as the <a href=\\\"https://bethkaplin.org/current-projects/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">rewilding of Akagera
        National Park</a>. In this project \u2013 which is funded by the National
        Geographic Society \u2013 eDNA sampling of sediment cores and sample surface
        sediments are combined with natural history observations, and used to understand
        biodiversity patterns and assist park management in their plan for reintroductions.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        <a href=\\\"https://www.cbd.int/abs/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\">Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-sharing</a> became effective
        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.
        As Jocelyn explained, \u201Cthe heart of the Nagoya protocol is community
        consent \u2013 informed consent from indigenous people\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        makes the consolidation even more extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers
        went from 47% of the market in 2000 to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest
        publishers from 54% to controlling 83% of the corpus.</p>\\n<cite>https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/10/30/quantifying-consolidation-in-the-scholarly-journals-market/</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s
        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access
        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such
        policies. The whole system rests on this logic of extraction and that&#8217;s

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im Bereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen betont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und Finanzierungsmodellen, die weder
        die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen finanziell belasten und sich durch angemessene
        und transparente Preise auszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird beklagt, dass die steigenden
        Preise f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Fachinformationen zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren
        und die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil der Forschung belasten
        (Punkt 5).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Aufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen Verlagswesen
        wird in zwei bemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung von nicht gewinnorientierten
        Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe Council
        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article
        processing charges or similar per-unit charges and stresses the importance
        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [&#8230;] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers
        are limited in their choice of publication channels due to financial capacities
        rather than quality criteria, and where access to research publications is
        restricted by paywalls\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zwar sind diese Unterstreichung
        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung
        eines pluralistischen, transparenten und nachhaltigen Systems der digtialen
        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die
        Kritik an dem Modell der Publikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Erst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den USA, als
        Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker Einrichtungen, das APC-Modell<a
        href=\\\"https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/\\\">
        deutlich kritisiert</a>. Die Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        Ungleichheit f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut ausgestatteten
        Regionen beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt werden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch hat der
        \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5\\\">R\xFCcktritt</a>
        des Editorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender
        APCs den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die zur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues Journal <a href=\\\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/\\\">gegr\xFCndet</a>,
        das niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das Problem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Um
        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,
        soll die Koordinierung innerhalb der EU und mit globalen Partnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung
        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt
        werden, um die Anzahl von not-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly
        publishing models in Europe with no costs for authors or readers&#8221; signifikant
        zu erh\xF6hen (Absatz 11).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch soll das Anliegen durch
        eine m\xF6gliche Beteiligung der EU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe
        (ORE), der von der EU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr
        Autor:innen aus den EU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        der <a href=\\\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/\\\">Pressemitteilung</a>
        werden weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen augegriffen:&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CSome
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into their national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly publications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national open access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications immediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions acknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like within the framework of the European Open
        Science Cloud (EOSC), and suggest including open science monitoring in the
        European Research Area monitoring mechanism.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Die Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer Tr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu begr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote
        und -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder gemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig zu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf internationaler
        Ebene zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Daf\xFCr sind, wie das Papier richtig
        betont, abgestimmte F\xF6rderaktivit\xE4ten erforderlich, die beispielsweise
        in Deutschland, komplement\xE4r zu DEAL, dem wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizieren
        einen deutlichen Aufschwung geben.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/kz04m-s8z58\",\"guid\":\"https://wisspub.net/?p=20455\",\"id\":\"1c578558-1324-4493-b8af-84c49eabc52f\",\"image\":\"https://wisspub.files.wordpress.com/2023/05/bildschirmc2adfoto-2023-05-23-um-11.05.39.png?w=723\",\"language\":\"de\",\"published_at\":1684833413,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"Die

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im Bereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen betont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und Finanzierungsmodellen, die weder
        die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen finanziell belasten und sich durch angemessene
        und transparente Preise auszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird beklagt, dass die steigenden
        Preise f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Fachinformationen zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren
        und die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil der Forschung belasten
        (Punkt 5).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Aufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen Verlagswesen
        wird in zwei bemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung von nicht gewinnorientierten
        Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe Council
        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article
        processing charges or similar per-unit charges and stresses the importance
        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [&#8230;] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers
        are limited in their choice of publication channels due to financial capacities
        rather than quality criteria, and where access to research publications is
        restricted by paywalls\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zwar sind diese Unterstreichung
        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung
        eines pluralistischen, transparenten und nachhaltigen Systems der digtialen
        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die
        Kritik an dem Modell der Publikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Erst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den USA, als
        Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker Einrichtungen, das APC-Modell<a
        href=\\\"https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/\\\">
        deutlich kritisiert</a>. Die Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        Ungleichheit f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut ausgestatteten
        Regionen beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt werden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch hat der
        \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5\\\">R\xFCcktritt</a>
        des Editorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender
        APCs den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die zur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues Journal <a href=\\\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/\\\">gegr\xFCndet</a>,
        das niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das Problem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Um
        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,
        soll die Koordinierung innerhalb der EU und mit globalen Partnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung
        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt
        werden, um die Anzahl von not-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly
        publishing models in Europe with no costs for authors or readers&#8221; signifikant
        zu erh\xF6hen (Absatz 11).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch soll das Anliegen durch
        eine m\xF6gliche Beteiligung der EU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe
        (ORE), der von der EU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr
        Autor:innen aus den EU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        der <a href=\\\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/\\\">Pressemitteilung</a>
        werden weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen augegriffen:&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CSome
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into their national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly publications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national open access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications immediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions acknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like within the framework of the European Open
        Science Cloud (EOSC), and suggest including open science monitoring in the
        European Research Area monitoring mechanism.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Die Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer Tr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu begr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote
        und -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder gemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig zu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf internationaler
        Ebene zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Daf\xFCr sind, wie das Papier richtig
        betont, abgestimmte F\xF6rderaktivit\xE4ten erforderlich, die beispielsweise
        in Deutschland, komplement\xE4r zu DEAL, dem wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizieren
        einen deutlichen Aufschwung geben.</p>\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/kz04m-s8z58\",\"reference\":[],\"summary\":\"Die

        Small: Community-Owned Futures for Open Access Books\u201D</a>,</strong> April
        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the

        citations, sharing, and reuse?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This project combines
        two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to
        merge these interests.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q2.
        <strong>What questions or challenges were you setting out to address when
        you started this work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of our big questions
        in the project as a whole is to learn more about how researchers cite data
        in their work and for which purposes, and to think about how this varies by
        academic discipline. We started out by looking at this question bibliometrically
        in <a href=\\\"https://zenodo.org/record/4730857#.ZD9Mo-xByEs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">work</a> led by Anton with DataCite. The survey
        which we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question
        from a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em>
        they cite data (spoiler &#8211; it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a

        show intellectual debt), to help others to find data, or to support the validity
        of their research claims. Few respondents indicated that external factors,

        some significant disciplinary differences to this question, though. For example,
        social science and humanities (SHH) researchers selected that they cite data
        to acknowledge intellectual debt more frequently than expected. One possible
        explanation for this could be tied to common purposes for which our SSH respondents
        reuse data (e.g. to serve as the basis for a new study or to integrate sources
        to build an argument).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"

        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q5.

        perhaps some people may have tried to reuse data previously. I bring this

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q7. <strong>Why is your study important?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        data also show that most researchers who are citing data (in any way) report
        doing so for reasons in line with responsibly conducting research. This suggests
        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their
        communities and their own ethical principles. If this is the case, the questions
        I see which we need to consider are: When (and how) do we meet researchers
        where they are? When should their research practice be adapted to current
        technical requirements and our own recommendations for data citation, and
        when should those requirements and recommendations be adapted to reflect researchers\u2019
        actual practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\u2019s an important reminder that we
        need to take our time and involve research communities in the development
        of policies and systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>To stay up to date

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q1. <strong>What drew you into studying data
        citations, sharing, and reuse?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This project combines
        two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to
        merge these interests.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q2.
        <strong>What questions or challenges were you setting out to address when
        you started this work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of our big questions
        in the project as a whole is to learn more about how researchers cite data
        in their work and for which purposes, and to think about how this varies by
        academic discipline. We started out by looking at this question bibliometrically
        in <a href=\\\"https://zenodo.org/record/4730857#.ZD9Mo-xByEs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">work</a> led by Anton with DataCite. The survey
        which we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question
        from a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em>
        they cite data (spoiler &#8211; it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a
        reference list) and <em>what </em>they actually cite (another spoiler &#8211;\_
        it isn\u2019t always a dataset) but also to learn more about <em>why</em>
        they do so.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the strengths of the survey is the
        care that we took with constructing a sample which, to the best of our efforts,
        is representative of academic authors by discipline, as represented in the
        Web of Science. This took many discussions to think about how best to do this,
        and much planning, but it also allows our findings to be stronger and perhaps

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q7. <strong>Why is your study important?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        data also show that most researchers who are citing data (in any way) report
        doing so for reasons in line with responsibly conducting research. This suggests
        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their
        communities and their own ethical principles. If this is the case, the questions
        I see which we need to consider are: When (and how) do we meet researchers
        where they are? When should their research practice be adapted to current
        technical requirements and our own recommendations for data citation, and
        when should those requirements and recommendations be adapted to reflect researchers\u2019
        actual practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\u2019s an important reminder that we
        need to take our time and involve research communities in the development
        of policies and systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>To stay up to date

        Ryder </strong>(San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance IUCN-SSC Animal Biobanking

        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus

        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells
        from Willa, a black-footed female ferret who died in the 1980s and who had
        no living descendants.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image is-resized\\\"><img

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate
        functioning iPSCs from frozen cell lines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>From Fieldwork to BioBank</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Whereas
        there was clear focus on BioBanking at the GGBN conference, I was additionally
        interested to hear that GGBN standards are useful from a rewilding perspective.
        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental
        specimen metadata is used for decision making in projects such as the <a href=\\\"https://bethkaplin.org/current-projects/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">rewilding of Akagera
        National Park</a>. In this project \u2013 which is funded by the National

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.
        As Jocelyn explained, \u201Cthe heart of the Nagoya protocol is community
        consent \u2013 informed consent from indigenous people\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus
        przewalskii</em></a><em> </em>was foaled on August 6th 2020 and was named
        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells
        from Willa, a black-footed female ferret who died in the 1980s and who had
        no living descendants.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image is-resized\\\"><img

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate
        functioning iPSCs from frozen cell lines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        there was clear focus on BioBanking at the GGBN conference, I was additionally
        interested to hear that GGBN standards are useful from a rewilding perspective.
        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.
        As Jocelyn explained, \u201Cthe heart of the Nagoya protocol is community
        consent \u2013 informed consent from indigenous people\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        makes the consolidation even more extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers
        went from 47% of the market in 2000 to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest

        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access
        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such
        policies. The whole system rests on this logic of extraction and that&#8217;s

        principles, open education, resources, and more. Of course, this is not the
        end of the process. Among other things, next steps include focused discussions
        with department heads, administrators, and others. I imagine that getting
        to a place where open scholarship/open science is well-understood and hopefully
        a default institutional position for research and education will require ongoing
        work. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The recommendations in the report tend to be specific
        within the context of Concordia University but I felt it worthwhile to write
        about here because the process, the findings, and the recommendations may
        be of interest to others. Perhaps you would like to try something similar
        at your institution? The Concordia work could be one model to reflect on what
        would work well or not so well in your own context.</p>\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/pk905-p9r05\",\"reference\":[],\"summary\":\"The

        Publikationswesens befasst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bereits im Vorfeld der Sitzung
        der Wissenschaftsministerien wurden verschiedene Versionen der Erkl\xE4rung
        \xF6ffentlich diskutiert (siehe z.B.<a href=\\\"https://sciencebusiness.net/news/Universities/leaked-eu-member-states-set-out-reform-scientific-publishing\\\">
        Science Business</a> und<a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/can-eu-make-parallel-publishing-system-work\\\">
        Times Higher Education</a>). Im Kern stand die Frage, inwiefern das EU-Papier
        den Fokus auf Finanzierungs- und Gesch\xE4ftsmodelle abseits von Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        (Article Processing Charges, APCs) legt und ob sogar eine Abkehr von der Unterst\xFCtzung
        dieses Modells durch die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa betont wird.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Schweden
        hatte das Thema im Rahmen seiner EU-Ratspr\xE4sidentschaft augegriffen und
        bereits im <a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2023/02/10/eu-wissenschaftsministerien-erortern-open-science/\\\">Februar</a>
        in einem Hintergrund-Papier adressiert. Schon in diesem Briefing Paper wurde
        die Problematik steigender Preise f\xFCr die wissenschaftlichen Fachinformation
        betont.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In der jetzt verabschiedeten Version der Schlussfolgerungen
        die Forderung nach sofortigem Open Access f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Publikationen,
        die im Rahmen der \xF6ffentlich gef\xF6rderten Forschung entstehen, nochmals
        betont. Dieses Ziel wurde<a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2016/05/27/eu-und-g7-staaten-setzen-auf-open-science/\\\">
        bereits 2016</a> von den EU-Wissenschaftsministerien erhoben. Die Wissenschaftsminister:innen
        hatten damals einen Open-Access-Anteil von 100 % bis 2020 gefordert. Dieser
        Wert wurde bisher jedoch nicht erreicht. In Deutschland liegt der Open-Access-Anteil
        zum Beispiel bei <a href=\\\"https://open-access-monitor.de/\\\">63</a> Prozent,
        w\xE4hrend die Niederlande im Publikationsjahr 2021 einen Anteil von <a href=\\\"https://www.openaccess.nl/en/in-the-netherlands/monitor\\\">82</a>\_Prozent

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im Bereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen betont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und Finanzierungsmodellen, die weder
        die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen finanziell belasten und sich durch angemessene
        und transparente Preise auszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird beklagt, dass die steigenden
        Preise f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Fachinformationen zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren
        und die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil der Forschung belasten
        (Punkt 5).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Aufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen Verlagswesen
        wird in zwei bemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung von nicht gewinnorientierten
        Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe Council
        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article
        processing charges or similar per-unit charges and stresses the importance
        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [&#8230;] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers
        are limited in their choice of publication channels due to financial capacities
        rather than quality criteria, and where access to research publications is
        restricted by paywalls\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zwar sind diese Unterstreichung
        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung
        eines pluralistischen, transparenten und nachhaltigen Systems der digtialen
        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die
        Kritik an dem Modell der Publikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Erst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den USA, als
        Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker Einrichtungen, das APC-Modell<a
        href=\\\"https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/\\\">
        deutlich kritisiert</a>. Die Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        Ungleichheit f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut ausgestatteten
        Regionen beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt werden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch hat der
        \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5\\\">R\xFCcktritt</a>
        des Editorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender
        APCs den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die zur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues Journal <a href=\\\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/\\\">gegr\xFCndet</a>,
        das niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das Problem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Um
        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,
        soll die Koordinierung innerhalb der EU und mit globalen Partnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung
        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt
        werden, um die Anzahl von not-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly
        publishing models in Europe with no costs for authors or readers&#8221; signifikant
        zu erh\xF6hen (Absatz 11).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch soll das Anliegen durch
        eine m\xF6gliche Beteiligung der EU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe
        (ORE), der von der EU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr
        Autor:innen aus den EU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        der <a href=\\\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/\\\">Pressemitteilung</a>
        werden weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen augegriffen:&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CSome
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into their national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly publications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national open access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications immediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions acknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like within the framework of the European Open
        Science Cloud (EOSC), and suggest including open science monitoring in the
        European Research Area monitoring mechanism.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Die Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer Tr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu begr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote
        und -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder gemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig zu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf internationaler

        der deutschen Version</a>)\_mit den aktuellen Herausforderungen des wissenschaftlichen
        Publikationswesens befasst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bereits im Vorfeld der Sitzung
        der Wissenschaftsministerien wurden verschiedene Versionen der Erkl\xE4rung
        \xF6ffentlich diskutiert (siehe z.B.<a href=\\\"https://sciencebusiness.net/news/Universities/leaked-eu-member-states-set-out-reform-scientific-publishing\\\">
        Science Business</a> und<a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/can-eu-make-parallel-publishing-system-work\\\">
        Times Higher Education</a>). Im Kern stand die Frage, inwiefern das EU-Papier
        den Fokus auf Finanzierungs- und Gesch\xE4ftsmodelle abseits von Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        (Article Processing Charges, APCs) legt und ob sogar eine Abkehr von der Unterst\xFCtzung
        dieses Modells durch die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa betont wird.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Schweden
        hatte das Thema im Rahmen seiner EU-Ratspr\xE4sidentschaft augegriffen und
        bereits im <a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2023/02/10/eu-wissenschaftsministerien-erortern-open-science/\\\">Februar</a>
        in einem Hintergrund-Papier adressiert. Schon in diesem Briefing Paper wurde
        die Problematik steigender Preise f\xFCr die wissenschaftlichen Fachinformation
        betont.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In der jetzt verabschiedeten Version der Schlussfolgerungen
        die Forderung nach sofortigem Open Access f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Publikationen,
        die im Rahmen der \xF6ffentlich gef\xF6rderten Forschung entstehen, nochmals
        betont. Dieses Ziel wurde<a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2016/05/27/eu-und-g7-staaten-setzen-auf-open-science/\\\">
        bereits 2016</a> von den EU-Wissenschaftsministerien erhoben. Die Wissenschaftsminister:innen
        hatten damals einen Open-Access-Anteil von 100 % bis 2020 gefordert. Dieser
        Wert wurde bisher jedoch nicht erreicht. In Deutschland liegt der Open-Access-Anteil
        zum Beispiel bei <a href=\\\"https://open-access-monitor.de/\\\">63</a> Prozent,
        w\xE4hrend die Niederlande im Publikationsjahr 2021 einen Anteil von <a href=\\\"https://www.openaccess.nl/en/in-the-netherlands/monitor\\\">82</a>\_Prozent

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im Bereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen betont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und Finanzierungsmodellen, die weder
        die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen finanziell belasten und sich durch angemessene
        und transparente Preise auszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird beklagt, dass die steigenden
        Preise f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Fachinformationen zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren
        und die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil der Forschung belasten
        (Punkt 5).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Aufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen Verlagswesen
        wird in zwei bemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung von nicht gewinnorientierten
        Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe Council
        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article
        processing charges or similar per-unit charges and stresses the importance
        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [&#8230;] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers
        are limited in their choice of publication channels due to financial capacities
        rather than quality criteria, and where access to research publications is
        restricted by paywalls\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zwar sind diese Unterstreichung
        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung
        eines pluralistischen, transparenten und nachhaltigen Systems der digtialen
        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die
        Kritik an dem Modell der Publikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Erst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den USA, als
        Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker Einrichtungen, das APC-Modell<a
        href=\\\"https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/\\\">
        deutlich kritisiert</a>. Die Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        Ungleichheit f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut ausgestatteten
        Regionen beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt werden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch hat der
        \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5\\\">R\xFCcktritt</a>
        des Editorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender
        APCs den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die zur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues Journal <a href=\\\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/\\\">gegr\xFCndet</a>,
        das niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das Problem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Um
        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,
        soll die Koordinierung innerhalb der EU und mit globalen Partnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung
        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt
        werden, um die Anzahl von not-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly
        publishing models in Europe with no costs for authors or readers&#8221; signifikant
        zu erh\xF6hen (Absatz 11).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch soll das Anliegen durch
        eine m\xF6gliche Beteiligung der EU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe
        (ORE), der von der EU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr
        Autor:innen aus den EU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        der <a href=\\\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/\\\">Pressemitteilung</a>
        werden weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen augegriffen:&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CSome
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into their national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly publications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national open access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications immediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions acknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like within the framework of the European Open
        Science Cloud (EOSC), and suggest including open science monitoring in the
        European Research Area monitoring mechanism.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Die Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer Tr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu begr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote
        und -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder gemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig zu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf internationaler
        Ebene zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Daf\xFCr sind, wie das Papier richtig
        betont, abgestimmte F\xF6rderaktivit\xE4ten erforderlich, die beispielsweise
        in Deutschland, komplement\xE4r zu DEAL, dem wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizieren

        Small: Community-Owned Futures for Open Access Books\u201D</a>,</strong> April
        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        citations, sharing, and reuse?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This project combines
        two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to
        merge these interests.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q2.
        <strong>What questions or challenges were you setting out to address when
        you started this work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of our big questions
        in the project as a whole is to learn more about how researchers cite data
        in their work and for which purposes, and to think about how this varies by
        academic discipline. We started out by looking at this question bibliometrically
        in <a href=\\\"https://zenodo.org/record/4730857#.ZD9Mo-xByEs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">work</a> led by Anton with DataCite. The survey
        which we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question
        from a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em>
        they cite data (spoiler &#8211; it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a
        reference list) and <em>what </em>they actually cite (another spoiler &#8211;\_
        it isn\u2019t always a dataset) but also to learn more about <em>why</em>
        they do so.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the strengths of the survey is the
        care that we took with constructing a sample which, to the best of our efforts,
        is representative of academic authors by discipline, as represented in the
        Web of Science. This took many discussions to think about how best to do this,
        and much planning, but it also allows our findings to be stronger and perhaps
        more generalizable to the broader population.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q3.
        <strong>What motivates researchers who cite data to do so?\_</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across
        the entire sample, we found that the majority of reasons might be construed
        as motivations which reflect \u2018ideal\u2019 research practice (e.g. to
        show intellectual debt), to help others to find data, or to support the validity
        of their research claims. Few respondents indicated that external factors,
        namely being advised to do so by journals or publishers, was a motivating
        factor in their decision to cite data.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We did find
        some significant disciplinary differences to this question, though. For example,
        social science and humanities (SHH) researchers selected that they cite data
        to acknowledge intellectual debt more frequently than expected. One possible
        explanation for this could be tied to common purposes for which our SSH respondents
        reuse data (e.g. to serve as the basis for a new study or to integrate sources
        to build an argument).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q4. <strong>How do researchers prefer others
        to cite their work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Around 84% of all respondents
        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q5.
        <strong>In the survey, more than 450 respondents said that they do not reuse
        data. Why do some researchers not reuse data?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We
        asked people to self-identify as being a person who reuses data or one who
        does not. This classification itself is perhaps a bit problematic, as we know
        from <a href=\\\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2705/chapter-abstract/73133/Non-Users-Also-Matter?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past work</a> in Science
        and Technology Studies that \u2018usage\u2019 of something\u2014be that a
        car or the Internet or research data\u2014exists on a spectrum. A researcher
        may reuse data to teach a class once per year, or they may be involved in
        a years-long comparative study and be reusing data daily, or they may not
        reuse data at all.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That said, the most frequently selected
        options were that reusing data was not relevant to their research methods
        or in their research communities. Other less frequently selected reasons\u2014such
        as a lack of relevant data or difficulties finding data\u2014indicate that
        perhaps some people may have tried to reuse data previously. I bring this
        up as I think it is important to remember that this variation in practice
        exists, that not everyone is a re-user of data, and that other ways of conducting
        research are also valuable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q6.
        <strong>What are your most interesting or surprising findings?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps
        most surprising to me at a high level was how much our data had to say about
        the practices of SSH researchers. We found that SSH researchers are the only
        disciplinary groups who prefer that others cite or mention their own data,
        as opposed to other data objects (e.g. an article or a collection of data).
        This contrasts <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23529\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past scientometric work</a>
        showing that SSH scholars cite \u2018data studies,\u2019 rather than individual
        data files.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We were also able to identify unique differences
        between social scientists and humanities scholars, such as the tendency for
        humanities scholars to integrate data more than most other disciplinary groups
        or the pattern of social scientists to refer to related publications (rather
        than data) less than other groups.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q7. <strong>Why is your study important?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        data also show that most researchers who are citing data (in any way) report
        doing so for reasons in line with responsibly conducting research. This suggests
        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their
        communities and their own ethical principles. If this is the case, the questions
        I see which we need to consider are: When (and how) do we meet researchers
        where they are? When should their research practice be adapted to current
        technical requirements and our own recommendations for data citation, and
        when should those requirements and recommendations be adapted to reflect researchers\u2019
        actual practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\u2019s an important reminder that we
        need to take our time and involve research communities in the development
        of policies and systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>To stay up to date

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q4. <strong>How do researchers prefer others
        to cite their work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Around 84% of all respondents
        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q5.
        <strong>In the survey, more than 450 respondents said that they do not reuse
        data. Why do some researchers not reuse data?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We
        asked people to self-identify as being a person who reuses data or one who
        does not. This classification itself is perhaps a bit problematic, as we know
        from <a href=\\\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2705/chapter-abstract/73133/Non-Users-Also-Matter?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past work</a> in Science
        and Technology Studies that \u2018usage\u2019 of something\u2014be that a
        car or the Internet or research data\u2014exists on a spectrum. A researcher
        may reuse data to teach a class once per year, or they may be involved in
        a years-long comparative study and be reusing data daily, or they may not
        reuse data at all.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That said, the most frequently selected
        options were that reusing data was not relevant to their research methods
        or in their research communities. Other less frequently selected reasons\u2014such
        as a lack of relevant data or difficulties finding data\u2014indicate that
        perhaps some people may have tried to reuse data previously. I bring this
        up as I think it is important to remember that this variation in practice
        exists, that not everyone is a re-user of data, and that other ways of conducting
        research are also valuable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q6.
        <strong>What are your most interesting or surprising findings?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps
        most surprising to me at a high level was how much our data had to say about
        the practices of SSH researchers. We found that SSH researchers are the only
        disciplinary groups who prefer that others cite or mention their own data,
        as opposed to other data objects (e.g. an article or a collection of data).
        This contrasts <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23529\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past scientometric work</a>
        showing that SSH scholars cite \u2018data studies,\u2019 rather than individual
        data files.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We were also able to identify unique differences
        between social scientists and humanities scholars, such as the tendency for
        humanities scholars to integrate data more than most other disciplinary groups
        or the pattern of social scientists to refer to related publications (rather
        than data) less than other groups.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q7. <strong>Why is your study important?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        data also show that most researchers who are citing data (in any way) report
        doing so for reasons in line with responsibly conducting research. This suggests
        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their
        communities and their own ethical principles. If this is the case, the questions
        I see which we need to consider are: When (and how) do we meet researchers
        where they are? When should their research practice be adapted to current
        technical requirements and our own recommendations for data citation, and
        when should those requirements and recommendations be adapted to reflect researchers\u2019
        actual practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\u2019s an important reminder that we
        need to take our time and involve research communities in the development
        of policies and systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>To stay up to date

        the Global Decline in Biodiversity: The GGBN Perspective</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Oliver
        Ryder </strong>(San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance IUCN-SSC Animal Biobanking

        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus

        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells
        from Willa, a black-footed female ferret who died in the 1980s and who had

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben

        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.
        As Jocelyn explained, \u201Cthe heart of the Nagoya protocol is community

        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the

        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks

        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"

        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered

        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.

        makes the consolidation even more extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers
        went from 47% of the market in 2000 to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest

        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays

        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such

        processes and supports within an institution can, I&#8217;ve noticed, demand
        a bit of effort to change. When we speak of <strong>open scholarship</strong>
        or <strong>open science</strong>, many aspects tie-in or lead out from those
        concepts, which makes the whole prospect of institutional change quite complex.
        I&#8217;m very excited about the efforts so far that the Open Science Working
        Group (of which I&#8217;m a participant) at Concordia University has undertaken
        and accomplished. These include an initial report on &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.11573/spectrum.library.concordia.ca.00992647\\\"><strong>Recommendations

        course, the Library is always doing outreach about open access (OA). In the
        past I&#8217;ve organized activities, events, and <a href=\\\"https://chroknowlogy.ca/intellectual-liberty/2022/talk-broad-value-open-access/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"post\\\" data-id=\\\"64563\\\">projects</a> for <a href=\\\"https://www.openaccessweek.org/\\\">open
        access week</a>. I can see how frequently our modern research practices, which
        involve digital techniques are enabled by the various forms of open: open
        source, open data, open protocols, open access, etc. However, I&#8217;ve always
        found that it&#8217;s a struggle to get people&#8217;s interest and that we
        have to be creative in order to educate about OA issues. Part of what I suspect
        makes advocating for OA difficult is the sort of singularity that comes from
        being &#8220;just the library,&#8221; the group that&#8217;s always talking
        about it. So when this Open Science Working Group formed, I was excited about
        its multidisciplinary nature and that it included both students and faculty.
        I think that really helps to broaden involvement across the university.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        working group, led by colleagues Krista Byers-Heinlein (who is also Concordia
        University Research Chair in Bilingualism and Open Science) and Nicol\xE1s
        Alessandroni, initiated the effort through a day-long <a href=\\\"https://www.concordia.ca/cuevents/artsci/2022/05/27/open-science-concordia.html\\\">conference
        on open science</a> in 2022. Later they established the working group by inviting
        people to participate in a workshop (there were over 20 people representing
        many disciplines). The workshop operated through a modified form of DORA&#8217;s
        <a href=\\\"https://sfdora.org/resource/workshop-toolkit-to-introduce-the-space-rubric/\\\">SPACE
        rubric</a>, which was designed for academic institutions to use toward improving
        their policies. I think using that tool to organize such a large group of
        people toward a practical outcome was extremely beneficial. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        more meetings, discussions, and revisions the working group was able to produce
        a set of <a href=\\\"https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/id/eprint/992647/\\\">recommendations</a>
        to bolster open scholarship throughout the university. It addresses many issues,
        including existing policies, outreach, inter-institutional work, position
        principles, open education, resources, and more. Of course, this is not the
        end of the process. Among other things, next steps include focused discussions
        with department heads, administrators, and others. I imagine that getting

        institution can, I&#8217;ve noticed, demand a bit of effort to change. When
        we speak of <strong>open scholarship</strong> or <strong>open science</strong>,
        many aspects tie-in or lead out from those concepts, which makes the whole
        prospect of institutional change quite complex. I&#8217;m very excited about
        the efforts so far that the Open Science Working Group (of which I&#8217;m
        a participant) at Concordia University has undertaken and accomplished. These
        include an initial report on &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.11573/spectrum.library.concordia.ca.00992647\\\"><strong>Recommendations
        for Fostering Open Science at Concordia University</strong></a>&#8221; (DOI:
        10.11573/spectrum.library.concordia.ca.00992647) </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<!--more-->\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        course, the Library is always doing outreach about open access (OA). In the
        past I&#8217;ve organized activities, events, and <a href=\\\"https://chroknowlogy.ca/intellectual-liberty/2022/talk-broad-value-open-access/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"post\\\" data-id=\\\"64563\\\">projects</a> for <a href=\\\"https://www.openaccessweek.org/\\\">open
        access week</a>. I can see how frequently our modern research practices, which
        involve digital techniques are enabled by the various forms of open: open
        source, open data, open protocols, open access, etc. However, I&#8217;ve always
        found that it&#8217;s a struggle to get people&#8217;s interest and that we
        have to be creative in order to educate about OA issues. Part of what I suspect
        makes advocating for OA difficult is the sort of singularity that comes from
        being &#8220;just the library,&#8221; the group that&#8217;s always talking
        about it. So when this Open Science Working Group formed, I was excited about
        its multidisciplinary nature and that it included both students and faculty.
        I think that really helps to broaden involvement across the university.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        working group, led by colleagues Krista Byers-Heinlein (who is also Concordia
        University Research Chair in Bilingualism and Open Science) and Nicol\xE1s
        Alessandroni, initiated the effort through a day-long <a href=\\\"https://www.concordia.ca/cuevents/artsci/2022/05/27/open-science-concordia.html\\\">conference
        on open science</a> in 2022. Later they established the working group by inviting
        people to participate in a workshop (there were over 20 people representing
        many disciplines). The workshop operated through a modified form of DORA&#8217;s
        <a href=\\\"https://sfdora.org/resource/workshop-toolkit-to-introduce-the-space-rubric/\\\">SPACE
        rubric</a>, which was designed for academic institutions to use toward improving
        their policies. I think using that tool to organize such a large group of
        people toward a practical outcome was extremely beneficial. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        more meetings, discussions, and revisions the working group was able to produce
        a set of <a href=\\\"https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/id/eprint/992647/\\\">recommendations</a>
        to bolster open scholarship throughout the university. It addresses many issues,
        including existing policies, outreach, inter-institutional work, position
        principles, open education, resources, and more. Of course, this is not the
        end of the process. Among other things, next steps include focused discussions
        with department heads, administrators, and others. I imagine that getting
        to a place where open scholarship/open science is well-understood and hopefully
        a default institutional position for research and education will require ongoing
        work. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The recommendations in the report tend to be specific
        within the context of Concordia University but I felt it worthwhile to write

        der deutschen Version</a>)\_mit den aktuellen Herausforderungen des wissenschaftlichen
        Publikationswesens befasst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bereits im Vorfeld der Sitzung
        der Wissenschaftsministerien wurden verschiedene Versionen der Erkl\xE4rung
        \xF6ffentlich diskutiert (siehe z.B.<a href=\\\"https://sciencebusiness.net/news/Universities/leaked-eu-member-states-set-out-reform-scientific-publishing\\\">
        Science Business</a> und<a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/can-eu-make-parallel-publishing-system-work\\\">
        Times Higher Education</a>). Im Kern stand die Frage, inwiefern das EU-Papier
        den Fokus auf Finanzierungs- und Gesch\xE4ftsmodelle abseits von Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        (Article Processing Charges, APCs) legt und ob sogar eine Abkehr von der Unterst\xFCtzung
        dieses Modells durch die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa betont wird.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Schweden
        hatte das Thema im Rahmen seiner EU-Ratspr\xE4sidentschaft augegriffen und
        bereits im <a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2023/02/10/eu-wissenschaftsministerien-erortern-open-science/\\\">Februar</a>
        in einem Hintergrund-Papier adressiert. Schon in diesem Briefing Paper wurde
        die Problematik steigender Preise f\xFCr die wissenschaftlichen Fachinformation
        betont.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In der jetzt verabschiedeten Version der Schlussfolgerungen
        die Forderung nach sofortigem Open Access f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Publikationen,
        die im Rahmen der \xF6ffentlich gef\xF6rderten Forschung entstehen, nochmals
        betont. Dieses Ziel wurde<a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2016/05/27/eu-und-g7-staaten-setzen-auf-open-science/\\\">
        bereits 2016</a> von den EU-Wissenschaftsministerien erhoben. Die Wissenschaftsminister:innen
        hatten damals einen Open-Access-Anteil von 100 % bis 2020 gefordert. Dieser
        Wert wurde bisher jedoch nicht erreicht. In Deutschland liegt der Open-Access-Anteil
        zum Beispiel bei <a href=\\\"https://open-access-monitor.de/\\\">63</a> Prozent,
        w\xE4hrend die Niederlande im Publikationsjahr 2021 einen Anteil von <a href=\\\"https://www.openaccess.nl/en/in-the-netherlands/monitor\\\">82</a>\_Prozent

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im Bereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen betont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und Finanzierungsmodellen, die weder
        die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen finanziell belasten und sich durch angemessene
        und transparente Preise auszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird beklagt, dass die steigenden
        Preise f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Fachinformationen zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren
        und die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil der Forschung belasten

        Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe Council
        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article
        processing charges or similar per-unit charges and stresses the importance
        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [&#8230;] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers
        are limited in their choice of publication channels due to financial capacities
        rather than quality criteria, and where access to research publications is
        restricted by paywalls\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zwar sind diese Unterstreichung
        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung
        eines pluralistischen, transparenten und nachhaltigen Systems der digtialen
        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die
        Kritik an dem Modell der Publikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Erst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den USA, als

        href=\\\"https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/\\\">
        deutlich kritisiert</a>. Die Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        Ungleichheit f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut ausgestatteten
        Regionen beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt werden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch hat der

        des Editorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender
        APCs den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die zur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues Journal <a href=\\\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/\\\">gegr\xFCndet</a>,
        das niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das Problem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Um
        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,
        soll die Koordinierung innerhalb der EU und mit globalen Partnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung
        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt
        werden, um die Anzahl von not-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly
        publishing models in Europe with no costs for authors or readers&#8221; signifikant
        zu erh\xF6hen (Absatz 11).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch soll das Anliegen durch
        eine m\xF6gliche Beteiligung der EU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe
        (ORE), der von der EU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr

        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into their national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly publications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national open access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications immediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions acknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like within the framework of the European Open

        der Wissenschaftsministerien wurden verschiedene Versionen der Erkl\xE4rung
        \xF6ffentlich diskutiert (siehe z.B.<a href=\\\"https://sciencebusiness.net/news/Universities/leaked-eu-member-states-set-out-reform-scientific-publishing\\\">
        Science Business</a> und<a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/can-eu-make-parallel-publishing-system-work\\\">
        Times Higher Education</a>). Im Kern stand die Frage, inwiefern das EU-Papier
        den Fokus auf Finanzierungs- und Gesch\xE4ftsmodelle abseits von Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        (Article Processing Charges, APCs) legt und ob sogar eine Abkehr von der Unterst\xFCtzung
        dieses Modells durch die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa betont wird.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Schweden
        hatte das Thema im Rahmen seiner EU-Ratspr\xE4sidentschaft augegriffen und
        bereits im <a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2023/02/10/eu-wissenschaftsministerien-erortern-open-science/\\\">Februar</a>
        in einem Hintergrund-Papier adressiert. Schon in diesem Briefing Paper wurde
        die Problematik steigender Preise f\xFCr die wissenschaftlichen Fachinformation
        betont.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In der jetzt verabschiedeten Version der Schlussfolgerungen
        die Forderung nach sofortigem Open Access f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Publikationen,
        die im Rahmen der \xF6ffentlich gef\xF6rderten Forschung entstehen, nochmals
        betont. Dieses Ziel wurde<a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2016/05/27/eu-und-g7-staaten-setzen-auf-open-science/\\\">
        bereits 2016</a> von den EU-Wissenschaftsministerien erhoben. Die Wissenschaftsminister:innen
        hatten damals einen Open-Access-Anteil von 100 % bis 2020 gefordert. Dieser
        Wert wurde bisher jedoch nicht erreicht. In Deutschland liegt der Open-Access-Anteil
        zum Beispiel bei <a href=\\\"https://open-access-monitor.de/\\\">63</a> Prozent,
        w\xE4hrend die Niederlande im Publikationsjahr 2021 einen Anteil von <a href=\\\"https://www.openaccess.nl/en/in-the-netherlands/monitor\\\">82</a>\_Prozent

        Small: Community-Owned Futures for Open Access Books\u201D</a>,</strong> April
        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q1. <strong>What drew you into studying data
        citations, sharing, and reuse?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This project combines
        two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to
        merge these interests.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q2.
        <strong>What questions or challenges were you setting out to address when
        you started this work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of our big questions
        in the project as a whole is to learn more about how researchers cite data
        in their work and for which purposes, and to think about how this varies by
        academic discipline. We started out by looking at this question bibliometrically
        in <a href=\\\"https://zenodo.org/record/4730857#.ZD9Mo-xByEs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">work</a> led by Anton with DataCite. The survey
        which we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question
        from a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em>
        they cite data (spoiler &#8211; it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a
        reference list) and <em>what </em>they actually cite (another spoiler &#8211;\_
        it isn\u2019t always a dataset) but also to learn more about <em>why</em>
        they do so.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the strengths of the survey is the
        care that we took with constructing a sample which, to the best of our efforts,
        is representative of academic authors by discipline, as represented in the
        Web of Science. This took many discussions to think about how best to do this,
        and much planning, but it also allows our findings to be stronger and perhaps
        more generalizable to the broader population.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q3.
        <strong>What motivates researchers who cite data to do so?\_</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across
        the entire sample, we found that the majority of reasons might be construed
        as motivations which reflect \u2018ideal\u2019 research practice (e.g. to
        show intellectual debt), to help others to find data, or to support the validity
        of their research claims. Few respondents indicated that external factors,
        namely being advised to do so by journals or publishers, was a motivating
        factor in their decision to cite data.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We did find
        some significant disciplinary differences to this question, though. For example,
        social science and humanities (SHH) researchers selected that they cite data
        to acknowledge intellectual debt more frequently than expected. One possible
        explanation for this could be tied to common purposes for which our SSH respondents
        reuse data (e.g. to serve as the basis for a new study or to integrate sources
        to build an argument).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q4. <strong>How do researchers prefer others
        to cite their work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Around 84% of all respondents
        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q5.
        <strong>In the survey, more than 450 respondents said that they do not reuse
        data. Why do some researchers not reuse data?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We
        asked people to self-identify as being a person who reuses data or one who
        does not. This classification itself is perhaps a bit problematic, as we know
        from <a href=\\\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2705/chapter-abstract/73133/Non-Users-Also-Matter?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past work</a> in Science
        and Technology Studies that \u2018usage\u2019 of something\u2014be that a
        car or the Internet or research data\u2014exists on a spectrum. A researcher
        may reuse data to teach a class once per year, or they may be involved in
        a years-long comparative study and be reusing data daily, or they may not
        reuse data at all.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That said, the most frequently selected
        options were that reusing data was not relevant to their research methods
        or in their research communities. Other less frequently selected reasons\u2014such
        as a lack of relevant data or difficulties finding data\u2014indicate that
        perhaps some people may have tried to reuse data previously. I bring this
        up as I think it is important to remember that this variation in practice
        exists, that not everyone is a re-user of data, and that other ways of conducting
        research are also valuable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q6.
        <strong>What are your most interesting or surprising findings?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps
        most surprising to me at a high level was how much our data had to say about
        the practices of SSH researchers. We found that SSH researchers are the only
        disciplinary groups who prefer that others cite or mention their own data,
        as opposed to other data objects (e.g. an article or a collection of data).
        This contrasts <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23529\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past scientometric work</a>
        showing that SSH scholars cite \u2018data studies,\u2019 rather than individual
        data files.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We were also able to identify unique differences
        between social scientists and humanities scholars, such as the tendency for
        humanities scholars to integrate data more than most other disciplinary groups
        or the pattern of social scientists to refer to related publications (rather
        than data) less than other groups.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q7. <strong>Why is your study important?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        data also show that most researchers who are citing data (in any way) report
        doing so for reasons in line with responsibly conducting research. This suggests
        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their
        communities and their own ethical principles. If this is the case, the questions
        I see which we need to consider are: When (and how) do we meet researchers
        where they are? When should their research practice be adapted to current
        technical requirements and our own recommendations for data citation, and
        when should those requirements and recommendations be adapted to reflect researchers\u2019
        actual practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\u2019s an important reminder that we
        need to take our time and involve research communities in the development
        of policies and systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>To stay up to date

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q1. <strong>What drew you into studying data
        citations, sharing, and reuse?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This project combines
        two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to
        merge these interests.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q2.
        <strong>What questions or challenges were you setting out to address when
        you started this work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of our big questions
        in the project as a whole is to learn more about how researchers cite data
        in their work and for which purposes, and to think about how this varies by
        academic discipline. We started out by looking at this question bibliometrically
        in <a href=\\\"https://zenodo.org/record/4730857#.ZD9Mo-xByEs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">work</a> led by Anton with DataCite. The survey
        which we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question
        from a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em>
        they cite data (spoiler &#8211; it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a
        reference list) and <em>what </em>they actually cite (another spoiler &#8211;\_
        it isn\u2019t always a dataset) but also to learn more about <em>why</em>
        they do so.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the strengths of the survey is the
        care that we took with constructing a sample which, to the best of our efforts,
        is representative of academic authors by discipline, as represented in the
        Web of Science. This took many discussions to think about how best to do this,
        and much planning, but it also allows our findings to be stronger and perhaps
        more generalizable to the broader population.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q3.
        <strong>What motivates researchers who cite data to do so?\_</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across
        the entire sample, we found that the majority of reasons might be construed
        as motivations which reflect \u2018ideal\u2019 research practice (e.g. to
        show intellectual debt), to help others to find data, or to support the validity
        of their research claims. Few respondents indicated that external factors,
        namely being advised to do so by journals or publishers, was a motivating
        factor in their decision to cite data.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We did find
        some significant disciplinary differences to this question, though. For example,
        social science and humanities (SHH) researchers selected that they cite data
        to acknowledge intellectual debt more frequently than expected. One possible
        explanation for this could be tied to common purposes for which our SSH respondents
        reuse data (e.g. to serve as the basis for a new study or to integrate sources
        to build an argument).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q4. <strong>How do researchers prefer others
        to cite their work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Around 84% of all respondents
        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q5.
        <strong>In the survey, more than 450 respondents said that they do not reuse
        data. Why do some researchers not reuse data?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We
        asked people to self-identify as being a person who reuses data or one who
        does not. This classification itself is perhaps a bit problematic, as we know
        from <a href=\\\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2705/chapter-abstract/73133/Non-Users-Also-Matter?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past work</a> in Science
        and Technology Studies that \u2018usage\u2019 of something\u2014be that a
        car or the Internet or research data\u2014exists on a spectrum. A researcher
        may reuse data to teach a class once per year, or they may be involved in
        a years-long comparative study and be reusing data daily, or they may not
        reuse data at all.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That said, the most frequently selected
        options were that reusing data was not relevant to their research methods
        or in their research communities. Other less frequently selected reasons\u2014such
        as a lack of relevant data or difficulties finding data\u2014indicate that
        perhaps some people may have tried to reuse data previously. I bring this
        up as I think it is important to remember that this variation in practice
        exists, that not everyone is a re-user of data, and that other ways of conducting
        research are also valuable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q6.
        <strong>What are your most interesting or surprising findings?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps
        most surprising to me at a high level was how much our data had to say about
        the practices of SSH researchers. We found that SSH researchers are the only
        disciplinary groups who prefer that others cite or mention their own data,
        as opposed to other data objects (e.g. an article or a collection of data).
        This contrasts <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23529\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past scientometric work</a>
        showing that SSH scholars cite \u2018data studies,\u2019 rather than individual
        data files.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We were also able to identify unique differences
        between social scientists and humanities scholars, such as the tendency for
        humanities scholars to integrate data more than most other disciplinary groups
        or the pattern of social scientists to refer to related publications (rather
        than data) less than other groups.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q7. <strong>Why is your study important?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        data also show that most researchers who are citing data (in any way) report
        doing so for reasons in line with responsibly conducting research. This suggests
        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their
        communities and their own ethical principles. If this is the case, the questions
        I see which we need to consider are: When (and how) do we meet researchers
        where they are? When should their research practice be adapted to current
        technical requirements and our own recommendations for data citation, and
        when should those requirements and recommendations be adapted to reflect researchers\u2019
        actual practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\u2019s an important reminder that we
        need to take our time and involve research communities in the development
        of policies and systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>To stay up to date

        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate
        functioning iPSCs from frozen cell lines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        there was clear focus on BioBanking at the GGBN conference, I was additionally
        interested to hear that GGBN standards are useful from a rewilding perspective.
        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.
        As Jocelyn explained, \u201Cthe heart of the Nagoya protocol is community

        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation

        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen

        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the

        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks

        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben

        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the

        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing

        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental

        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.

        to 2022 where they control 61% of it. Looking at larger sets of publishers
        makes the consolidation even more extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers
        went from 47% of the market in 2000 to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest
        publishers from 54% to controlling 83% of the corpus.</p>\\n<cite>https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/10/30/quantifying-consolidation-in-the-scholarly-journals-market/</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s
        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access
        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such
        policies. The whole system rests on this logic of extraction and that&#8217;s
        what needs to be opposed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/z8017-00204\",\"guid\":\"https://www.samuelmoore.org/?p=1437\",\"id\":\"95fef4ed-6274-47ed-a682-494ef1cb85ef\",\"image\":\"https://www.samuelmoore.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/R229.aa364024.jpg\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1698678686,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"Today\u2019s

        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access
        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such
        policies. The whole system rests on this logic of extraction and that&#8217;s
        what needs to be opposed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/z8017-00204\",\"reference\":[],\"summary\":\"Today\u2019s

        involve digital techniques are enabled by the various forms of open: open
        source, open data, open protocols, open access, etc. However, I&#8217;ve always
        found that it&#8217;s a struggle to get people&#8217;s interest and that we
        have to be creative in order to educate about OA issues. Part of what I suspect
        makes advocating for OA difficult is the sort of singularity that comes from
        being &#8220;just the library,&#8221; the group that&#8217;s always talking
        about it. So when this Open Science Working Group formed, I was excited about

        on open science</a> in 2022. Later they established the working group by inviting
        people to participate in a workshop (there were over 20 people representing
        many disciplines). The workshop operated through a modified form of DORA&#8217;s

        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,

        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt

        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into their national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly publications which

        and guidelines to make scholarly publications immediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions acknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like within the framework of the European Open
        Science Cloud (EOSC), and suggest including open science monitoring in the
        European Research Area monitoring mechanism.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Die Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer Tr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu begr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote
        und -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder gemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig zu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf internationaler
        Ebene zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Daf\xFCr sind, wie das Papier richtig
        betont, abgestimmte F\xF6rderaktivit\xE4ten erforderlich, die beispielsweise
        in Deutschland, komplement\xE4r zu DEAL, dem wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizieren

        Small: Community-Owned Futures for Open Access Books\u201D</a>,</strong> April
        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q1. <strong>What drew you into studying data
        citations, sharing, and reuse?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This project combines
        two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to
        merge these interests.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q2.
        <strong>What questions or challenges were you setting out to address when
        you started this work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of our big questions
        in the project as a whole is to learn more about how researchers cite data
        in their work and for which purposes, and to think about how this varies by
        academic discipline. We started out by looking at this question bibliometrically
        in <a href=\\\"https://zenodo.org/record/4730857#.ZD9Mo-xByEs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">work</a> led by Anton with DataCite. The survey
        which we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question
        from a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em>
        they cite data (spoiler &#8211; it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a
        reference list) and <em>what </em>they actually cite (another spoiler &#8211;\_
        it isn\u2019t always a dataset) but also to learn more about <em>why</em>
        they do so.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the strengths of the survey is the
        care that we took with constructing a sample which, to the best of our efforts,
        is representative of academic authors by discipline, as represented in the
        Web of Science. This took many discussions to think about how best to do this,
        and much planning, but it also allows our findings to be stronger and perhaps
        more generalizable to the broader population.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q3.
        <strong>What motivates researchers who cite data to do so?\_</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across
        the entire sample, we found that the majority of reasons might be construed
        as motivations which reflect \u2018ideal\u2019 research practice (e.g. to
        show intellectual debt), to help others to find data, or to support the validity
        of their research claims. Few respondents indicated that external factors,
        namely being advised to do so by journals or publishers, was a motivating
        factor in their decision to cite data.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We did find
        some significant disciplinary differences to this question, though. For example,
        social science and humanities (SHH) researchers selected that they cite data
        to acknowledge intellectual debt more frequently than expected. One possible
        explanation for this could be tied to common purposes for which our SSH respondents
        reuse data (e.g. to serve as the basis for a new study or to integrate sources
        to build an argument).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q4. <strong>How do researchers prefer others
        to cite their work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Around 84% of all respondents
        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q5.
        <strong>In the survey, more than 450 respondents said that they do not reuse
        data. Why do some researchers not reuse data?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We
        asked people to self-identify as being a person who reuses data or one who
        does not. This classification itself is perhaps a bit problematic, as we know
        from <a href=\\\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2705/chapter-abstract/73133/Non-Users-Also-Matter?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past work</a> in Science
        and Technology Studies that \u2018usage\u2019 of something\u2014be that a
        car or the Internet or research data\u2014exists on a spectrum. A researcher
        may reuse data to teach a class once per year, or they may be involved in
        a years-long comparative study and be reusing data daily, or they may not
        reuse data at all.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That said, the most frequently selected
        options were that reusing data was not relevant to their research methods
        or in their research communities. Other less frequently selected reasons\u2014such
        as a lack of relevant data or difficulties finding data\u2014indicate that
        perhaps some people may have tried to reuse data previously. I bring this
        up as I think it is important to remember that this variation in practice
        exists, that not everyone is a re-user of data, and that other ways of conducting
        research are also valuable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q6.
        <strong>What are your most interesting or surprising findings?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps
        most surprising to me at a high level was how much our data had to say about
        the practices of SSH researchers. We found that SSH researchers are the only
        disciplinary groups who prefer that others cite or mention their own data,
        as opposed to other data objects (e.g. an article or a collection of data).
        This contrasts <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23529\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past scientometric work</a>
        showing that SSH scholars cite \u2018data studies,\u2019 rather than individual
        data files.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We were also able to identify unique differences
        between social scientists and humanities scholars, such as the tendency for
        humanities scholars to integrate data more than most other disciplinary groups
        or the pattern of social scientists to refer to related publications (rather
        than data) less than other groups.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\"

        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        data also show that most researchers who are citing data (in any way) report
        doing so for reasons in line with responsibly conducting research. This suggests
        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their
        communities and their own ethical principles. If this is the case, the questions
        I see which we need to consider are: When (and how) do we meet researchers
        where they are? When should their research practice be adapted to current
        technical requirements and our own recommendations for data citation, and
        when should those requirements and recommendations be adapted to reflect researchers\u2019
        actual practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\u2019s an important reminder that we
        need to take our time and involve research communities in the development
        of policies and systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>To stay up to date

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q1. <strong>What drew you into studying data
        citations, sharing, and reuse?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This project combines
        two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to
        merge these interests.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q2.
        <strong>What questions or challenges were you setting out to address when
        you started this work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of our big questions
        in the project as a whole is to learn more about how researchers cite data
        in their work and for which purposes, and to think about how this varies by
        academic discipline. We started out by looking at this question bibliometrically
        in <a href=\\\"https://zenodo.org/record/4730857#.ZD9Mo-xByEs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">work</a> led by Anton with DataCite. The survey
        which we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question
        from a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em>
        they cite data (spoiler &#8211; it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a
        reference list) and <em>what </em>they actually cite (another spoiler &#8211;\_
        it isn\u2019t always a dataset) but also to learn more about <em>why</em>
        they do so.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the strengths of the survey is the
        care that we took with constructing a sample which, to the best of our efforts,
        is representative of academic authors by discipline, as represented in the
        Web of Science. This took many discussions to think about how best to do this,
        and much planning, but it also allows our findings to be stronger and perhaps
        more generalizable to the broader population.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q3.
        <strong>What motivates researchers who cite data to do so?\_</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across
        the entire sample, we found that the majority of reasons might be construed
        as motivations which reflect \u2018ideal\u2019 research practice (e.g. to
        show intellectual debt), to help others to find data, or to support the validity
        of their research claims. Few respondents indicated that external factors,
        namely being advised to do so by journals or publishers, was a motivating
        factor in their decision to cite data.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We did find
        some significant disciplinary differences to this question, though. For example,
        social science and humanities (SHH) researchers selected that they cite data
        to acknowledge intellectual debt more frequently than expected. One possible
        explanation for this could be tied to common purposes for which our SSH respondents
        reuse data (e.g. to serve as the basis for a new study or to integrate sources
        to build an argument).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q4. <strong>How do researchers prefer others
        to cite their work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Around 84% of all respondents
        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q5.
        <strong>In the survey, more than 450 respondents said that they do not reuse
        data. Why do some researchers not reuse data?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We
        asked people to self-identify as being a person who reuses data or one who
        does not. This classification itself is perhaps a bit problematic, as we know
        from <a href=\\\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2705/chapter-abstract/73133/Non-Users-Also-Matter?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past work</a> in Science
        and Technology Studies that \u2018usage\u2019 of something\u2014be that a
        car or the Internet or research data\u2014exists on a spectrum. A researcher
        may reuse data to teach a class once per year, or they may be involved in
        a years-long comparative study and be reusing data daily, or they may not
        reuse data at all.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That said, the most frequently selected
        options were that reusing data was not relevant to their research methods
        or in their research communities. Other less frequently selected reasons\u2014such
        as a lack of relevant data or difficulties finding data\u2014indicate that
        perhaps some people may have tried to reuse data previously. I bring this
        up as I think it is important to remember that this variation in practice
        exists, that not everyone is a re-user of data, and that other ways of conducting
        research are also valuable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q6.
        <strong>What are your most interesting or surprising findings?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps
        most surprising to me at a high level was how much our data had to say about
        the practices of SSH researchers. We found that SSH researchers are the only
        disciplinary groups who prefer that others cite or mention their own data,
        as opposed to other data objects (e.g. an article or a collection of data).
        This contrasts <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23529\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past scientometric work</a>
        showing that SSH scholars cite \u2018data studies,\u2019 rather than individual
        data files.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We were also able to identify unique differences
        between social scientists and humanities scholars, such as the tendency for
        humanities scholars to integrate data more than most other disciplinary groups
        or the pattern of social scientists to refer to related publications (rather
        than data) less than other groups.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\"

        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our

        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their

        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN
        Secretariat hosted and supported by the National Museum of Natural History,

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus
        przewalskii</em></a><em> </em>was foaled on August 6th 2020 and was named
        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells
        from Willa, a black-footed female ferret who died in the 1980s and who had
        no living descendants.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image is-resized\\\"><img

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate
        functioning iPSCs from frozen cell lines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        there was clear focus on BioBanking at the GGBN conference, I was additionally
        interested to hear that GGBN standards are useful from a rewilding perspective.
        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.

        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN
        Secretariat hosted and supported by the National Museum of Natural History,

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus

        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate
        functioning iPSCs from frozen cell lines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.

        since 2000 \u2014 when the top 5 publishers held 39% of the market of articles
        to 2022 where they control 61% of it. Looking at larger sets of publishers
        makes the consolidation even more extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers
        went from 47% of the market in 2000 to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest
        publishers from 54% to controlling 83% of the corpus.</p>\\n<cite>https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/10/30/quantifying-consolidation-in-the-scholarly-journals-market/</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s
        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume

        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between

        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such
        policies. The whole system rests on this logic of extraction and that&#8217;s

        post is an attempt by David Crotty &#8212; the blog&#8217;s editor &#8212;
        to quantify the increasing consolidation of the academic publishing industry.
        Crotty concludes:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p>Overall,
        the market has significantly consolidated since 2000 \u2014 when the top 5
        publishers held 39% of the market of articles to 2022 where they control 61%
        of it. Looking at larger sets of publishers makes the consolidation even more
        extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers went from 47% of the market in 2000
        to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest publishers from 54% to controlling
        83% of the corpus.</p>\\n<cite>https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/10/30/quantifying-consolidation-in-the-scholarly-journals-market/</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s
        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access

        found that it&#8217;s a struggle to get people&#8217;s interest and that we
        have to be creative in order to educate about OA issues. Part of what I suspect

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im Bereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen betont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und Finanzierungsmodellen, die weder
        die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen finanziell belasten und sich durch angemessene
        und transparente Preise auszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird beklagt, dass die steigenden
        Preise f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Fachinformationen zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren
        und die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil der Forschung belasten
        (Punkt 5).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Aufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen Verlagswesen
        wird in zwei bemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung von nicht gewinnorientierten
        Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe Council
        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article
        processing charges or similar per-unit charges and stresses the importance
        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [&#8230;] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers
        are limited in their choice of publication channels due to financial capacities
        rather than quality criteria, and where access to research publications is
        restricted by paywalls\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zwar sind diese Unterstreichung
        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung
        eines pluralistischen, transparenten und nachhaltigen Systems der digtialen
        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die
        Kritik an dem Modell der Publikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Erst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den USA, als
        Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker Einrichtungen, das APC-Modell<a
        href=\\\"https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/\\\">
        deutlich kritisiert</a>. Die Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        Ungleichheit f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut ausgestatteten
        Regionen beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt werden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch hat der
        \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5\\\">R\xFCcktritt</a>
        des Editorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender
        APCs den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die zur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues Journal <a href=\\\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/\\\">gegr\xFCndet</a>,
        das niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das Problem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Um
        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,
        soll die Koordinierung innerhalb der EU und mit globalen Partnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung
        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt
        werden, um die Anzahl von not-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly
        publishing models in Europe with no costs for authors or readers&#8221; signifikant
        zu erh\xF6hen (Absatz 11).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch soll das Anliegen durch
        eine m\xF6gliche Beteiligung der EU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe
        (ORE), der von der EU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr
        Autor:innen aus den EU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        der <a href=\\\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/\\\">Pressemitteilung</a>
        werden weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen augegriffen:&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CSome
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into their national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly publications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national open access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications immediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions acknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like within the framework of the European Open
        Science Cloud (EOSC), and suggest including open science monitoring in the
        European Research Area monitoring mechanism.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Die Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer Tr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu begr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote
        und -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder gemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig zu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf internationaler
        Ebene zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Daf\xFCr sind, wie das Papier richtig
        betont, abgestimmte F\xF6rderaktivit\xE4ten erforderlich, die beispielsweise
        in Deutschland, komplement\xE4r zu DEAL, dem wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizieren
        einen deutlichen Aufschwung geben.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/kz04m-s8z58\",\"guid\":\"https://wisspub.net/?p=20455\",\"id\":\"1c578558-1324-4493-b8af-84c49eabc52f\",\"image\":\"https://wisspub.files.wordpress.com/2023/05/bildschirmc2adfoto-2023-05-23-um-11.05.39.png?w=723\",\"language\":\"de\",\"published_at\":1684833413,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"Die

        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und Finanzierungsmodellen, die weder
        die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen finanziell belasten und sich durch angemessene
        und transparente Preise auszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird beklagt, dass die steigenden
        Preise f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Fachinformationen zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren
        und die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil der Forschung belasten
        (Punkt 5).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Aufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen Verlagswesen
        wird in zwei bemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung von nicht gewinnorientierten
        Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe Council
        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article
        processing charges or similar per-unit charges and stresses the importance
        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [&#8230;] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers
        are limited in their choice of publication channels due to financial capacities
        rather than quality criteria, and where access to research publications is
        restricted by paywalls\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zwar sind diese Unterstreichung
        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung
        eines pluralistischen, transparenten und nachhaltigen Systems der digtialen
        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die
        Kritik an dem Modell der Publikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Erst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den USA, als
        Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker Einrichtungen, das APC-Modell<a
        href=\\\"https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/\\\">
        deutlich kritisiert</a>. Die Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        Ungleichheit f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut ausgestatteten
        Regionen beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt werden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch hat der
        \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5\\\">R\xFCcktritt</a>
        des Editorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender
        APCs den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die zur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues Journal <a href=\\\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/\\\">gegr\xFCndet</a>,
        das niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das Problem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Um
        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,
        soll die Koordinierung innerhalb der EU und mit globalen Partnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung
        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt
        werden, um die Anzahl von not-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly
        publishing models in Europe with no costs for authors or readers&#8221; signifikant
        zu erh\xF6hen (Absatz 11).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch soll das Anliegen durch
        eine m\xF6gliche Beteiligung der EU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe
        (ORE), der von der EU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr
        Autor:innen aus den EU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        der <a href=\\\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/\\\">Pressemitteilung</a>
        werden weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen augegriffen:&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CSome
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into their national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly publications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national open access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications immediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions acknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like within the framework of the European Open
        Science Cloud (EOSC), and suggest including open science monitoring in the
        European Research Area monitoring mechanism.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Die Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer Tr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu begr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote
        und -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder gemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig zu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf internationaler
        Ebene zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Daf\xFCr sind, wie das Papier richtig
        betont, abgestimmte F\xF6rderaktivit\xE4ten erforderlich, die beispielsweise
        in Deutschland, komplement\xE4r zu DEAL, dem wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizieren
        einen deutlichen Aufschwung geben.</p>\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/kz04m-s8z58\",\"reference\":[],\"summary\":\"Die

        Small: Community-Owned Futures for Open Access Books\u201D</a>,</strong> April
        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q1. <strong>What drew you into studying data
        citations, sharing, and reuse?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This project combines
        two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to
        merge these interests.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q2.
        <strong>What questions or challenges were you setting out to address when
        you started this work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of our big questions
        in the project as a whole is to learn more about how researchers cite data
        in their work and for which purposes, and to think about how this varies by
        academic discipline. We started out by looking at this question bibliometrically
        in <a href=\\\"https://zenodo.org/record/4730857#.ZD9Mo-xByEs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">work</a> led by Anton with DataCite. The survey
        which we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question
        from a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em>
        they cite data (spoiler &#8211; it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a
        reference list) and <em>what </em>they actually cite (another spoiler &#8211;\_
        it isn\u2019t always a dataset) but also to learn more about <em>why</em>
        they do so.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the strengths of the survey is the
        care that we took with constructing a sample which, to the best of our efforts,
        is representative of academic authors by discipline, as represented in the
        Web of Science. This took many discussions to think about how best to do this,
        and much planning, but it also allows our findings to be stronger and perhaps
        more generalizable to the broader population.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q3.
        <strong>What motivates researchers who cite data to do so?\_</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across
        the entire sample, we found that the majority of reasons might be construed
        as motivations which reflect \u2018ideal\u2019 research practice (e.g. to
        show intellectual debt), to help others to find data, or to support the validity
        of their research claims. Few respondents indicated that external factors,
        namely being advised to do so by journals or publishers, was a motivating
        factor in their decision to cite data.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We did find
        some significant disciplinary differences to this question, though. For example,
        social science and humanities (SHH) researchers selected that they cite data
        to acknowledge intellectual debt more frequently than expected. One possible
        explanation for this could be tied to common purposes for which our SSH respondents
        reuse data (e.g. to serve as the basis for a new study or to integrate sources
        to build an argument).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q4. <strong>How do researchers prefer others
        to cite their work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Around 84% of all respondents
        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article

        perhaps some people may have tried to reuse data previously. I bring this

        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        data also show that most researchers who are citing data (in any way) report
        doing so for reasons in line with responsibly conducting research. This suggests
        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their
        communities and their own ethical principles. If this is the case, the questions
        I see which we need to consider are: When (and how) do we meet researchers
        where they are? When should their research practice be adapted to current
        technical requirements and our own recommendations for data citation, and
        when should those requirements and recommendations be adapted to reflect researchers\u2019
        actual practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\u2019s an important reminder that we
        need to take our time and involve research communities in the development
        of policies and systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>To stay up to date

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q1. <strong>What drew you into studying data
        citations, sharing, and reuse?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This project combines
        two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to
        merge these interests.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q2.
        <strong>What questions or challenges were you setting out to address when
        you started this work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of our big questions
        in the project as a whole is to learn more about how researchers cite data
        in their work and for which purposes, and to think about how this varies by
        academic discipline. We started out by looking at this question bibliometrically
        in <a href=\\\"https://zenodo.org/record/4730857#.ZD9Mo-xByEs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">work</a> led by Anton with DataCite. The survey
        which we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question
        from a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em>
        they cite data (spoiler &#8211; it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a
        reference list) and <em>what </em>they actually cite (another spoiler &#8211;\_
        it isn\u2019t always a dataset) but also to learn more about <em>why</em>
        they do so.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the strengths of the survey is the
        care that we took with constructing a sample which, to the best of our efforts,
        is representative of academic authors by discipline, as represented in the
        Web of Science. This took many discussions to think about how best to do this,
        and much planning, but it also allows our findings to be stronger and perhaps
        more generalizable to the broader population.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q3.
        <strong>What motivates researchers who cite data to do so?\_</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across
        the entire sample, we found that the majority of reasons might be construed
        as motivations which reflect \u2018ideal\u2019 research practice (e.g. to
        show intellectual debt), to help others to find data, or to support the validity
        of their research claims. Few respondents indicated that external factors,
        namely being advised to do so by journals or publishers, was a motivating
        factor in their decision to cite data.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We did find
        some significant disciplinary differences to this question, though. For example,
        social science and humanities (SHH) researchers selected that they cite data
        to acknowledge intellectual debt more frequently than expected. One possible
        explanation for this could be tied to common purposes for which our SSH respondents
        reuse data (e.g. to serve as the basis for a new study or to integrate sources
        to build an argument).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q4. <strong>How do researchers prefer others
        to cite their work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Around 84% of all respondents
        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q5.

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">standards</a>) introduced
        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN
        Secretariat hosted and supported by the National Museum of Natural History,

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus
        przewalskii</em></a><em> </em>was foaled on August 6th 2020 and was named
        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells
        from Willa, a black-footed female ferret who died in the 1980s and who had
        no living descendants.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image is-resized\\\"><img

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate
        functioning iPSCs from frozen cell lines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        toolkit, and some of the challenges for conservation.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>From Fieldwork to BioBank</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Whereas
        there was clear focus on BioBanking at the GGBN conference, I was additionally
        interested to hear that GGBN standards are useful from a rewilding perspective.
        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental
        specimen metadata is used for decision making in projects such as the <a href=\\\"https://bethkaplin.org/current-projects/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">rewilding of Akagera

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.
        As Jocelyn explained, \u201Cthe heart of the Nagoya protocol is community

        Press Data Scientist Chris Armit attended the conference and reports below
        on some of the highlights.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Confronting
        the Global Decline in Biodiversity: The GGBN Perspective</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Oliver
        Ryder </strong>(San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance IUCN-SSC Animal Biobanking
        for Conservation Specialist Group, and <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1186/2047-217X-3-32\\\"

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">standards</a>) introduced
        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN
        Secretariat hosted and supported by the National Museum of Natural History,
        Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC \u2013 aims to provide the necessary

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus
        przewalskii</em></a><em> </em>was foaled on August 6th 2020 and was named
        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells
        from Willa, a black-footed female ferret who died in the 1980s and who had
        no living descendants.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image is-resized\\\"><img

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate
        functioning iPSCs from frozen cell lines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        toolkit, and some of the challenges for conservation.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>From Fieldwork to BioBank</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Whereas
        there was clear focus on BioBanking at the GGBN conference, I was additionally
        interested to hear that GGBN standards are useful from a rewilding perspective.
        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental
        specimen metadata is used for decision making in projects such as the <a href=\\\"https://bethkaplin.org/current-projects/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">rewilding of Akagera

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.
        As Jocelyn explained, \u201Cthe heart of the Nagoya protocol is community

        makes the consolidation even more extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers
        went from 47% of the market in 2000 to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest
        publishers from 54% to controlling 83% of the corpus.</p>\\n<cite>https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/10/30/quantifying-consolidation-in-the-scholarly-journals-market/</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s
        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access
        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such
        policies. The whole system rests on this logic of extraction and that&#8217;s

        Publikationswesens befasst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bereits im Vorfeld der Sitzung
        der Wissenschaftsministerien wurden verschiedene Versionen der Erkl\xE4rung
        \xF6ffentlich diskutiert (siehe z.B.<a href=\\\"https://sciencebusiness.net/news/Universities/leaked-eu-member-states-set-out-reform-scientific-publishing\\\">
        Science Business</a> und<a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/can-eu-make-parallel-publishing-system-work\\\">
        Times Higher Education</a>). Im Kern stand die Frage, inwiefern das EU-Papier
        den Fokus auf Finanzierungs- und Gesch\xE4ftsmodelle abseits von Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        (Article Processing Charges, APCs) legt und ob sogar eine Abkehr von der Unterst\xFCtzung
        dieses Modells durch die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa betont wird.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Schweden
        hatte das Thema im Rahmen seiner EU-Ratspr\xE4sidentschaft augegriffen und
        bereits im <a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2023/02/10/eu-wissenschaftsministerien-erortern-open-science/\\\">Februar</a>
        in einem Hintergrund-Papier adressiert. Schon in diesem Briefing Paper wurde
        die Problematik steigender Preise f\xFCr die wissenschaftlichen Fachinformation

        die Forderung nach sofortigem Open Access f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Publikationen,
        die im Rahmen der \xF6ffentlich gef\xF6rderten Forschung entstehen, nochmals
        betont. Dieses Ziel wurde<a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2016/05/27/eu-und-g7-staaten-setzen-auf-open-science/\\\">
        bereits 2016</a> von den EU-Wissenschaftsministerien erhoben. Die Wissenschaftsminister:innen
        hatten damals einen Open-Access-Anteil von 100 % bis 2020 gefordert. Dieser
        Wert wurde bisher jedoch nicht erreicht. In Deutschland liegt der Open-Access-Anteil
        zum Beispiel bei <a href=\\\"https://open-access-monitor.de/\\\">63</a> Prozent,
        w\xE4hrend die Niederlande im Publikationsjahr 2021 einen Anteil von <a href=\\\"https://www.openaccess.nl/en/in-the-netherlands/monitor\\\">82</a>\_Prozent

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im Bereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen betont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und Finanzierungsmodellen, die weder
        die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen finanziell belasten und sich durch angemessene
        und transparente Preise auszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird beklagt, dass die steigenden
        Preise f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Fachinformationen zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren
        und die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil der Forschung belasten
        (Punkt 5).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Aufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen Verlagswesen
        wird in zwei bemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung von nicht gewinnorientierten
        Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe Council
        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article
        processing charges or similar per-unit charges and stresses the importance
        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [&#8230;] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers
        are limited in their choice of publication channels due to financial capacities
        rather than quality criteria, and where access to research publications is
        restricted by paywalls\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zwar sind diese Unterstreichung
        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung
        eines pluralistischen, transparenten und nachhaltigen Systems der digtialen
        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die
        Kritik an dem Modell der Publikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Erst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den USA, als
        Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker Einrichtungen, das APC-Modell<a
        href=\\\"https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/\\\">
        deutlich kritisiert</a>. Die Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        Ungleichheit f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut ausgestatteten
        Regionen beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt werden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch hat der
        \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5\\\">R\xFCcktritt</a>
        des Editorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender
        APCs den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die zur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues Journal <a href=\\\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/\\\">gegr\xFCndet</a>,
        das niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das Problem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Um
        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,
        soll die Koordinierung innerhalb der EU und mit globalen Partnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung
        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt
        werden, um die Anzahl von not-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly
        publishing models in Europe with no costs for authors or readers&#8221; signifikant
        zu erh\xF6hen (Absatz 11).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch soll das Anliegen durch
        eine m\xF6gliche Beteiligung der EU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe
        (ORE), der von der EU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr
        Autor:innen aus den EU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        der <a href=\\\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/\\\">Pressemitteilung</a>
        werden weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen augegriffen:&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CSome
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into their national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly publications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national open access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications immediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions acknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like within the framework of the European Open
        Science Cloud (EOSC), and suggest including open science monitoring in the
        European Research Area monitoring mechanism.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Die Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer Tr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu begr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote
        und -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder gemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig zu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf internationaler
        Ebene zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Daf\xFCr sind, wie das Papier richtig
        betont, abgestimmte F\xF6rderaktivit\xE4ten erforderlich, die beispielsweise
        in Deutschland, komplement\xE4r zu DEAL, dem wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizieren
        einen deutlichen Aufschwung geben.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/kz04m-s8z58\",\"guid\":\"https://wisspub.net/?p=20455\",\"id\":\"1c578558-1324-4493-b8af-84c49eabc52f\",\"image\":\"https://wisspub.files.wordpress.com/2023/05/bildschirmc2adfoto-2023-05-23-um-11.05.39.png?w=723\",\"language\":\"de\",\"published_at\":1684833413,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"Die

        (Article Processing Charges, APCs) legt und ob sogar eine Abkehr von der Unterst\xFCtzung
        dieses Modells durch die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa betont wird.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Schweden
        hatte das Thema im Rahmen seiner EU-Ratspr\xE4sidentschaft augegriffen und
        bereits im <a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2023/02/10/eu-wissenschaftsministerien-erortern-open-science/\\\">Februar</a>
        in einem Hintergrund-Papier adressiert. Schon in diesem Briefing Paper wurde
        die Problematik steigender Preise f\xFCr die wissenschaftlichen Fachinformation
        betont.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In der jetzt verabschiedeten Version der Schlussfolgerungen
        die Forderung nach sofortigem Open Access f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Publikationen,
        die im Rahmen der \xF6ffentlich gef\xF6rderten Forschung entstehen, nochmals
        betont. Dieses Ziel wurde<a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2016/05/27/eu-und-g7-staaten-setzen-auf-open-science/\\\">
        bereits 2016</a> von den EU-Wissenschaftsministerien erhoben. Die Wissenschaftsminister:innen
        hatten damals einen Open-Access-Anteil von 100 % bis 2020 gefordert. Dieser
        Wert wurde bisher jedoch nicht erreicht. In Deutschland liegt der Open-Access-Anteil
        zum Beispiel bei <a href=\\\"https://open-access-monitor.de/\\\">63</a> Prozent,
        w\xE4hrend die Niederlande im Publikationsjahr 2021 einen Anteil von <a href=\\\"https://www.openaccess.nl/en/in-the-netherlands/monitor\\\">82</a>\_Prozent

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im Bereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen betont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und Finanzierungsmodellen, die weder
        die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen finanziell belasten und sich durch angemessene
        und transparente Preise auszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird beklagt, dass die steigenden
        Preise f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Fachinformationen zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren
        und die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil der Forschung belasten
        (Punkt 5).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Aufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen Verlagswesen
        wird in zwei bemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung von nicht gewinnorientierten
        Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe Council
        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article
        processing charges or similar per-unit charges and stresses the importance
        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [&#8230;] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers
        are limited in their choice of publication channels due to financial capacities
        rather than quality criteria, and where access to research publications is
        restricted by paywalls\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zwar sind diese Unterstreichung
        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung
        eines pluralistischen, transparenten und nachhaltigen Systems der digtialen
        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die
        Kritik an dem Modell der Publikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Erst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den USA, als
        Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker Einrichtungen, das APC-Modell<a
        href=\\\"https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/\\\">
        deutlich kritisiert</a>. Die Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        Ungleichheit f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut ausgestatteten
        Regionen beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt werden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch hat der
        \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5\\\">R\xFCcktritt</a>
        des Editorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender
        APCs den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die zur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues Journal <a href=\\\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/\\\">gegr\xFCndet</a>,
        das niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das Problem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Um
        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,
        soll die Koordinierung innerhalb der EU und mit globalen Partnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung
        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt
        werden, um die Anzahl von not-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly
        publishing models in Europe with no costs for authors or readers&#8221; signifikant
        zu erh\xF6hen (Absatz 11).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch soll das Anliegen durch
        eine m\xF6gliche Beteiligung der EU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe
        (ORE), der von der EU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr
        Autor:innen aus den EU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        der <a href=\\\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/\\\">Pressemitteilung</a>
        werden weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen augegriffen:&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CSome
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into their national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly publications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national open access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications immediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions acknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like within the framework of the European Open
        Science Cloud (EOSC), and suggest including open science monitoring in the
        European Research Area monitoring mechanism.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Die Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer Tr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu begr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote
        und -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder gemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig zu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf internationaler
        Ebene zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Daf\xFCr sind, wie das Papier richtig
        betont, abgestimmte F\xF6rderaktivit\xE4ten erforderlich, die beispielsweise
        in Deutschland, komplement\xE4r zu DEAL, dem wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizieren
        einen deutlichen Aufschwung geben.</p>\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/kz04m-s8z58\",\"reference\":[],\"summary\":\"Die

        Small: Community-Owned Futures for Open Access Books\u201D</a>,</strong> April
        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise

        two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to
        merge these interests.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q2.
        <strong>What questions or challenges were you setting out to address when
        you started this work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of our big questions
        in the project as a whole is to learn more about how researchers cite data
        in their work and for which purposes, and to think about how this varies by
        academic discipline. We started out by looking at this question bibliometrically
        in <a href=\\\"https://zenodo.org/record/4730857#.ZD9Mo-xByEs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">work</a> led by Anton with DataCite. The survey
        which we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question
        from a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em>
        they cite data (spoiler &#8211; it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a
        reference list) and <em>what </em>they actually cite (another spoiler &#8211;\_
        it isn\u2019t always a dataset) but also to learn more about <em>why</em>
        they do so.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the strengths of the survey is the
        care that we took with constructing a sample which, to the best of our efforts,
        is representative of academic authors by discipline, as represented in the
        Web of Science. This took many discussions to think about how best to do this,
        and much planning, but it also allows our findings to be stronger and perhaps
        more generalizable to the broader population.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q3.
        <strong>What motivates researchers who cite data to do so?\_</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across
        the entire sample, we found that the majority of reasons might be construed
        as motivations which reflect \u2018ideal\u2019 research practice (e.g. to
        show intellectual debt), to help others to find data, or to support the validity
        of their research claims. Few respondents indicated that external factors,
        namely being advised to do so by journals or publishers, was a motivating
        factor in their decision to cite data.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We did find
        some significant disciplinary differences to this question, though. For example,
        social science and humanities (SHH) researchers selected that they cite data
        to acknowledge intellectual debt more frequently than expected. One possible
        explanation for this could be tied to common purposes for which our SSH respondents
        reuse data (e.g. to serve as the basis for a new study or to integrate sources
        to build an argument).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q4. <strong>How do researchers prefer others
        to cite their work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Around 84% of all respondents
        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q5.
        <strong>In the survey, more than 450 respondents said that they do not reuse
        data. Why do some researchers not reuse data?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We
        asked people to self-identify as being a person who reuses data or one who
        does not. This classification itself is perhaps a bit problematic, as we know
        from <a href=\\\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2705/chapter-abstract/73133/Non-Users-Also-Matter?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\"

        and Technology Studies that \u2018usage\u2019 of something\u2014be that a
        car or the Internet or research data\u2014exists on a spectrum. A researcher
        may reuse data to teach a class once per year, or they may be involved in
        a years-long comparative study and be reusing data daily, or they may not
        reuse data at all.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That said, the most frequently selected
        options were that reusing data was not relevant to their research methods
        or in their research communities. Other less frequently selected reasons\u2014such
        as a lack of relevant data or difficulties finding data\u2014indicate that
        perhaps some people may have tried to reuse data previously. I bring this
        up as I think it is important to remember that this variation in practice
        exists, that not everyone is a re-user of data, and that other ways of conducting
        research are also valuable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q6.
        <strong>What are your most interesting or surprising findings?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps
        most surprising to me at a high level was how much our data had to say about
        the practices of SSH researchers. We found that SSH researchers are the only
        disciplinary groups who prefer that others cite or mention their own data,
        as opposed to other data objects (e.g. an article or a collection of data).
        This contrasts <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23529\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past scientometric work</a>
        showing that SSH scholars cite \u2018data studies,\u2019 rather than individual
        data files.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We were also able to identify unique differences
        between social scientists and humanities scholars, such as the tendency for
        humanities scholars to integrate data more than most other disciplinary groups
        or the pattern of social scientists to refer to related publications (rather
        than data) less than other groups.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q7. <strong>Why is your study important?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        data also show that most researchers who are citing data (in any way) report
        doing so for reasons in line with responsibly conducting research. This suggests
        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their
        communities and their own ethical principles. If this is the case, the questions
        I see which we need to consider are: When (and how) do we meet researchers
        where they are? When should their research practice be adapted to current
        technical requirements and our own recommendations for data citation, and
        when should those requirements and recommendations be adapted to reflect researchers\u2019
        actual practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\u2019s an important reminder that we
        need to take our time and involve research communities in the development
        of policies and systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>To stay up to date

        perhaps some people may have tried to reuse data previously. I bring this
        up as I think it is important to remember that this variation in practice
        exists, that not everyone is a re-user of data, and that other ways of conducting
        research are also valuable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q6.
        <strong>What are your most interesting or surprising findings?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps
        most surprising to me at a high level was how much our data had to say about
        the practices of SSH researchers. We found that SSH researchers are the only
        disciplinary groups who prefer that others cite or mention their own data,
        as opposed to other data objects (e.g. an article or a collection of data).
        This contrasts <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23529\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past scientometric work</a>
        showing that SSH scholars cite \u2018data studies,\u2019 rather than individual
        data files.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We were also able to identify unique differences
        between social scientists and humanities scholars, such as the tendency for
        humanities scholars to integrate data more than most other disciplinary groups
        or the pattern of social scientists to refer to related publications (rather
        than data) less than other groups.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q7. <strong>Why is your study important?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        data also show that most researchers who are citing data (in any way) report
        doing so for reasons in line with responsibly conducting research. This suggests
        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their
        communities and their own ethical principles. If this is the case, the questions
        I see which we need to consider are: When (and how) do we meet researchers
        where they are? When should their research practice be adapted to current
        technical requirements and our own recommendations for data citation, and
        when should those requirements and recommendations be adapted to reflect researchers\u2019
        actual practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\u2019s an important reminder that we
        need to take our time and involve research communities in the development
        of policies and systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>To stay up to date

        the Global Decline in Biodiversity: The GGBN Perspective</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Oliver
        Ryder </strong>(San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance IUCN-SSC Animal Biobanking

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">standards</a>) introduced
        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus

        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate
        functioning iPSCs from frozen cell lines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve

        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role

        there was clear focus on BioBanking at the GGBN conference, I was additionally
        interested to hear that GGBN standards are useful from a rewilding perspective.
        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental
        specimen metadata is used for decision making in projects such as the <a href=\\\"https://bethkaplin.org/current-projects/\\\"

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.
        As Jocelyn explained, \u201Cthe heart of the Nagoya protocol is community
        consent \u2013 informed consent from indigenous people\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus

        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve

        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally

        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used

        there was clear focus on BioBanking at the GGBN conference, I was additionally
        interested to hear that GGBN standards are useful from a rewilding perspective.
        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental
        specimen metadata is used for decision making in projects such as the <a href=\\\"https://bethkaplin.org/current-projects/\\\"

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.
        As Jocelyn explained, \u201Cthe heart of the Nagoya protocol is community

        makes the consolidation even more extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers
        went from 47% of the market in 2000 to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest
        publishers from 54% to controlling 83% of the corpus.</p>\\n<cite>https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/10/30/quantifying-consolidation-in-the-scholarly-journals-market/</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s
        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access
        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such
        policies. The whole system rests on this logic of extraction and that&#8217;s

        involve digital techniques are enabled by the various forms of open: open
        source, open data, open protocols, open access, etc. However, I&#8217;ve always
        found that it&#8217;s a struggle to get people&#8217;s interest and that we
        have to be creative in order to educate about OA issues. Part of what I suspect
        makes advocating for OA difficult is the sort of singularity that comes from
        being &#8220;just the library,&#8221; the group that&#8217;s always talking
        about it. So when this Open Science Working Group formed, I was excited about
        its multidisciplinary nature and that it included both students and faculty.
        I think that really helps to broaden involvement across the university.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        working group, led by colleagues Krista Byers-Heinlein (who is also Concordia
        University Research Chair in Bilingualism and Open Science) and Nicol\xE1s
        Alessandroni, initiated the effort through a day-long <a href=\\\"https://www.concordia.ca/cuevents/artsci/2022/05/27/open-science-concordia.html\\\">conference
        on open science</a> in 2022. Later they established the working group by inviting
        people to participate in a workshop (there were over 20 people representing
        many disciplines). The workshop operated through a modified form of DORA&#8217;s
        <a href=\\\"https://sfdora.org/resource/workshop-toolkit-to-introduce-the-space-rubric/\\\">SPACE
        rubric</a>, which was designed for academic institutions to use toward improving
        their policies. I think using that tool to organize such a large group of
        people toward a practical outcome was extremely beneficial. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        more meetings, discussions, and revisions the working group was able to produce
        a set of <a href=\\\"https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/id/eprint/992647/\\\">recommendations</a>
        to bolster open scholarship throughout the university. It addresses many issues,
        including existing policies, outreach, inter-institutional work, position
        principles, open education, resources, and more. Of course, this is not the
        end of the process. Among other things, next steps include focused discussions
        with department heads, administrators, and others. I imagine that getting
        to a place where open scholarship/open science is well-understood and hopefully
        a default institutional position for research and education will require ongoing
        work. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The recommendations in the report tend to be specific
        within the context of Concordia University but I felt it worthwhile to write
        about here because the process, the findings, and the recommendations may
        be of interest to others. Perhaps you would like to try something similar
        at your institution? The Concordia work could be one model to reflect on what
        would work well or not so well in your own context.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/pk905-p9r05\",\"guid\":\"https://chroknowlogy.ca/?p=64616\",\"id\":\"b11b28bb-f44a-4dc7-a3ea-3917c603e3ef\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1692993161,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"The

        I think that really helps to broaden involvement across the university.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        working group, led by colleagues Krista Byers-Heinlein (who is also Concordia
        University Research Chair in Bilingualism and Open Science) and Nicol\xE1s
        Alessandroni, initiated the effort through a day-long <a href=\\\"https://www.concordia.ca/cuevents/artsci/2022/05/27/open-science-concordia.html\\\">conference
        on open science</a> in 2022. Later they established the working group by inviting
        people to participate in a workshop (there were over 20 people representing
        many disciplines). The workshop operated through a modified form of DORA&#8217;s
        <a href=\\\"https://sfdora.org/resource/workshop-toolkit-to-introduce-the-space-rubric/\\\">SPACE
        rubric</a>, which was designed for academic institutions to use toward improving
        their policies. I think using that tool to organize such a large group of
        people toward a practical outcome was extremely beneficial. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        more meetings, discussions, and revisions the working group was able to produce
        a set of <a href=\\\"https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/id/eprint/992647/\\\">recommendations</a>
        to bolster open scholarship throughout the university. It addresses many issues,
        including existing policies, outreach, inter-institutional work, position
        principles, open education, resources, and more. Of course, this is not the
        end of the process. Among other things, next steps include focused discussions
        with department heads, administrators, and others. I imagine that getting
        to a place where open scholarship/open science is well-understood and hopefully
        a default institutional position for research and education will require ongoing
        work. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The recommendations in the report tend to be specific
        within the context of Concordia University but I felt it worthwhile to write
        about here because the process, the findings, and the recommendations may
        be of interest to others. Perhaps you would like to try something similar
        at your institution? The Concordia work could be one model to reflect on what
        would work well or not so well in your own context.</p>\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/pk905-p9r05\",\"reference\":[],\"summary\":\"The

        der deutschen Version</a>)\_mit den aktuellen Herausforderungen des wissenschaftlichen
        Publikationswesens befasst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bereits im Vorfeld der Sitzung
        der Wissenschaftsministerien wurden verschiedene Versionen der Erkl\xE4rung
        \xF6ffentlich diskutiert (siehe z.B.<a href=\\\"https://sciencebusiness.net/news/Universities/leaked-eu-member-states-set-out-reform-scientific-publishing\\\">
        Science Business</a> und<a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/can-eu-make-parallel-publishing-system-work\\\">
        Times Higher Education</a>). Im Kern stand die Frage, inwiefern das EU-Papier
        den Fokus auf Finanzierungs- und Gesch\xE4ftsmodelle abseits von Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        (Article Processing Charges, APCs) legt und ob sogar eine Abkehr von der Unterst\xFCtzung
        dieses Modells durch die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa betont wird.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Schweden
        hatte das Thema im Rahmen seiner EU-Ratspr\xE4sidentschaft augegriffen und
        bereits im <a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2023/02/10/eu-wissenschaftsministerien-erortern-open-science/\\\">Februar</a>
        in einem Hintergrund-Papier adressiert. Schon in diesem Briefing Paper wurde
        die Problematik steigender Preise f\xFCr die wissenschaftlichen Fachinformation
        betont.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In der jetzt verabschiedeten Version der Schlussfolgerungen
        die Forderung nach sofortigem Open Access f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Publikationen,
        die im Rahmen der \xF6ffentlich gef\xF6rderten Forschung entstehen, nochmals
        betont. Dieses Ziel wurde<a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2016/05/27/eu-und-g7-staaten-setzen-auf-open-science/\\\">
        bereits 2016</a> von den EU-Wissenschaftsministerien erhoben. Die Wissenschaftsminister:innen
        hatten damals einen Open-Access-Anteil von 100 % bis 2020 gefordert. Dieser
        Wert wurde bisher jedoch nicht erreicht. In Deutschland liegt der Open-Access-Anteil
        zum Beispiel bei <a href=\\\"https://open-access-monitor.de/\\\">63</a> Prozent,
        w\xE4hrend die Niederlande im Publikationsjahr 2021 einen Anteil von <a href=\\\"https://www.openaccess.nl/en/in-the-netherlands/monitor\\\">82</a>\_Prozent

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im Bereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen betont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und Finanzierungsmodellen, die weder
        die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen finanziell belasten und sich durch angemessene
        und transparente Preise auszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird beklagt, dass die steigenden
        Preise f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Fachinformationen zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren
        und die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil der Forschung belasten
        (Punkt 5).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Aufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen Verlagswesen
        wird in zwei bemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung von nicht gewinnorientierten
        Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe Council
        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article
        processing charges or similar per-unit charges and stresses the importance
        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [&#8230;] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers
        are limited in their choice of publication channels due to financial capacities
        rather than quality criteria, and where access to research publications is
        restricted by paywalls\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zwar sind diese Unterstreichung
        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung
        eines pluralistischen, transparenten und nachhaltigen Systems der digtialen
        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die
        Kritik an dem Modell der Publikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Erst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den USA, als
        Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker Einrichtungen, das APC-Modell<a
        href=\\\"https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/\\\">
        deutlich kritisiert</a>. Die Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        Ungleichheit f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut ausgestatteten
        Regionen beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt werden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch hat der
        \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5\\\">R\xFCcktritt</a>
        des Editorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender
        APCs den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die zur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues Journal <a href=\\\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/\\\">gegr\xFCndet</a>,
        das niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das Problem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Um
        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,
        soll die Koordinierung innerhalb der EU und mit globalen Partnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung
        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt
        werden, um die Anzahl von not-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly
        publishing models in Europe with no costs for authors or readers&#8221; signifikant
        zu erh\xF6hen (Absatz 11).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch soll das Anliegen durch
        eine m\xF6gliche Beteiligung der EU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe

        Publikationswesens befasst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bereits im Vorfeld der Sitzung
        der Wissenschaftsministerien wurden verschiedene Versionen der Erkl\xE4rung
        \xF6ffentlich diskutiert (siehe z.B.<a href=\\\"https://sciencebusiness.net/news/Universities/leaked-eu-member-states-set-out-reform-scientific-publishing\\\">
        Science Business</a> und<a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/can-eu-make-parallel-publishing-system-work\\\">
        Times Higher Education</a>). Im Kern stand die Frage, inwiefern das EU-Papier
        den Fokus auf Finanzierungs- und Gesch\xE4ftsmodelle abseits von Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        (Article Processing Charges, APCs) legt und ob sogar eine Abkehr von der Unterst\xFCtzung
        dieses Modells durch die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa betont wird.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Schweden
        hatte das Thema im Rahmen seiner EU-Ratspr\xE4sidentschaft augegriffen und
        bereits im <a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2023/02/10/eu-wissenschaftsministerien-erortern-open-science/\\\">Februar</a>
        in einem Hintergrund-Papier adressiert. Schon in diesem Briefing Paper wurde
        die Problematik steigender Preise f\xFCr die wissenschaftlichen Fachinformation
        betont.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In der jetzt verabschiedeten Version der Schlussfolgerungen
        die Forderung nach sofortigem Open Access f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Publikationen,
        die im Rahmen der \xF6ffentlich gef\xF6rderten Forschung entstehen, nochmals
        betont. Dieses Ziel wurde<a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2016/05/27/eu-und-g7-staaten-setzen-auf-open-science/\\\">
        bereits 2016</a> von den EU-Wissenschaftsministerien erhoben. Die Wissenschaftsminister:innen
        hatten damals einen Open-Access-Anteil von 100 % bis 2020 gefordert. Dieser
        Wert wurde bisher jedoch nicht erreicht. In Deutschland liegt der Open-Access-Anteil
        zum Beispiel bei <a href=\\\"https://open-access-monitor.de/\\\">63</a> Prozent,
        w\xE4hrend die Niederlande im Publikationsjahr 2021 einen Anteil von <a href=\\\"https://www.openaccess.nl/en/in-the-netherlands/monitor\\\">82</a>\_Prozent

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im Bereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen betont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und Finanzierungsmodellen, die weder
        die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen finanziell belasten und sich durch angemessene
        und transparente Preise auszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird beklagt, dass die steigenden
        Preise f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Fachinformationen zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren
        und die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil der Forschung belasten
        (Punkt 5).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Aufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen Verlagswesen
        wird in zwei bemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung von nicht gewinnorientierten
        Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe Council
        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article
        processing charges or similar per-unit charges and stresses the importance
        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [&#8230;] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers
        are limited in their choice of publication channels due to financial capacities
        rather than quality criteria, and where access to research publications is
        restricted by paywalls\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zwar sind diese Unterstreichung
        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung
        eines pluralistischen, transparenten und nachhaltigen Systems der digtialen
        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die
        Kritik an dem Modell der Publikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Erst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den USA, als
        Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker Einrichtungen, das APC-Modell<a
        href=\\\"https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/\\\">
        deutlich kritisiert</a>. Die Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        Ungleichheit f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut ausgestatteten
        Regionen beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt werden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch hat der
        \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5\\\">R\xFCcktritt</a>
        des Editorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender
        APCs den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die zur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues Journal <a href=\\\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/\\\">gegr\xFCndet</a>,
        das niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das Problem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Um
        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,
        soll die Koordinierung innerhalb der EU und mit globalen Partnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung
        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt
        werden, um die Anzahl von not-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly
        publishing models in Europe with no costs for authors or readers&#8221; signifikant
        zu erh\xF6hen (Absatz 11).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch soll das Anliegen durch
        eine m\xF6gliche Beteiligung der EU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe
        (ORE), der von der EU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr
        Autor:innen aus den EU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In

        Small: Community-Owned Futures for Open Access Books\u201D</a>,</strong> April
        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q1. <strong>What drew you into studying data
        citations, sharing, and reuse?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This project combines
        two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to
        merge these interests.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q2.
        <strong>What questions or challenges were you setting out to address when
        you started this work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of our big questions
        in the project as a whole is to learn more about how researchers cite data
        in their work and for which purposes, and to think about how this varies by
        academic discipline. We started out by looking at this question bibliometrically
        in <a href=\\\"https://zenodo.org/record/4730857#.ZD9Mo-xByEs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">work</a> led by Anton with DataCite. The survey
        which we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question
        from a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em>
        they cite data (spoiler &#8211; it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a
        reference list) and <em>what </em>they actually cite (another spoiler &#8211;\_
        it isn\u2019t always a dataset) but also to learn more about <em>why</em>
        they do so.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the strengths of the survey is the
        care that we took with constructing a sample which, to the best of our efforts,
        is representative of academic authors by discipline, as represented in the
        Web of Science. This took many discussions to think about how best to do this,
        and much planning, but it also allows our findings to be stronger and perhaps
        more generalizable to the broader population.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q3.
        <strong>What motivates researchers who cite data to do so?\_</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across
        the entire sample, we found that the majority of reasons might be construed
        as motivations which reflect \u2018ideal\u2019 research practice (e.g. to
        show intellectual debt), to help others to find data, or to support the validity
        of their research claims. Few respondents indicated that external factors,
        namely being advised to do so by journals or publishers, was a motivating
        factor in their decision to cite data.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We did find
        some significant disciplinary differences to this question, though. For example,
        social science and humanities (SHH) researchers selected that they cite data
        to acknowledge intellectual debt more frequently than expected. One possible
        explanation for this could be tied to common purposes for which our SSH respondents
        reuse data (e.g. to serve as the basis for a new study or to integrate sources
        to build an argument).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q4. <strong>How do researchers prefer others
        to cite their work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Around 84% of all respondents
        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q5.
        <strong>In the survey, more than 450 respondents said that they do not reuse
        data. Why do some researchers not reuse data?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We
        asked people to self-identify as being a person who reuses data or one who
        does not. This classification itself is perhaps a bit problematic, as we know
        from <a href=\\\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2705/chapter-abstract/73133/Non-Users-Also-Matter?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past work</a> in Science
        and Technology Studies that \u2018usage\u2019 of something\u2014be that a
        car or the Internet or research data\u2014exists on a spectrum. A researcher
        may reuse data to teach a class once per year, or they may be involved in
        a years-long comparative study and be reusing data daily, or they may not
        reuse data at all.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That said, the most frequently selected
        options were that reusing data was not relevant to their research methods
        or in their research communities. Other less frequently selected reasons\u2014such
        as a lack of relevant data or difficulties finding data\u2014indicate that
        perhaps some people may have tried to reuse data previously. I bring this
        up as I think it is important to remember that this variation in practice
        exists, that not everyone is a re-user of data, and that other ways of conducting
        research are also valuable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q6.
        <strong>What are your most interesting or surprising findings?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps
        most surprising to me at a high level was how much our data had to say about
        the practices of SSH researchers. We found that SSH researchers are the only
        disciplinary groups who prefer that others cite or mention their own data,
        as opposed to other data objects (e.g. an article or a collection of data).
        This contrasts <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23529\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past scientometric work</a>
        showing that SSH scholars cite \u2018data studies,\u2019 rather than individual
        data files.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We were also able to identify unique differences
        between social scientists and humanities scholars, such as the tendency for
        humanities scholars to integrate data more than most other disciplinary groups
        or the pattern of social scientists to refer to related publications (rather
        than data) less than other groups.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q7. <strong>Why is your study important?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        data also show that most researchers who are citing data (in any way) report
        doing so for reasons in line with responsibly conducting research. This suggests
        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their
        communities and their own ethical principles. If this is the case, the questions
        I see which we need to consider are: When (and how) do we meet researchers
        where they are? When should their research practice be adapted to current
        technical requirements and our own recommendations for data citation, and
        when should those requirements and recommendations be adapted to reflect researchers\u2019
        actual practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\u2019s an important reminder that we
        need to take our time and involve research communities in the development
        of policies and systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>To stay up to date

        more generalizable to the broader population.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q3.
        <strong>What motivates researchers who cite data to do so?\_</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across
        the entire sample, we found that the majority of reasons might be construed
        as motivations which reflect \u2018ideal\u2019 research practice (e.g. to
        show intellectual debt), to help others to find data, or to support the validity
        of their research claims. Few respondents indicated that external factors,
        namely being advised to do so by journals or publishers, was a motivating
        factor in their decision to cite data.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We did find
        some significant disciplinary differences to this question, though. For example,
        social science and humanities (SHH) researchers selected that they cite data
        to acknowledge intellectual debt more frequently than expected. One possible
        explanation for this could be tied to common purposes for which our SSH respondents
        reuse data (e.g. to serve as the basis for a new study or to integrate sources
        to build an argument).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q4. <strong>How do researchers prefer others
        to cite their work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Around 84% of all respondents
        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q5.
        <strong>In the survey, more than 450 respondents said that they do not reuse
        data. Why do some researchers not reuse data?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We
        asked people to self-identify as being a person who reuses data or one who
        does not. This classification itself is perhaps a bit problematic, as we know
        from <a href=\\\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2705/chapter-abstract/73133/Non-Users-Also-Matter?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past work</a> in Science
        and Technology Studies that \u2018usage\u2019 of something\u2014be that a
        car or the Internet or research data\u2014exists on a spectrum. A researcher
        may reuse data to teach a class once per year, or they may be involved in
        a years-long comparative study and be reusing data daily, or they may not
        reuse data at all.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That said, the most frequently selected
        options were that reusing data was not relevant to their research methods
        or in their research communities. Other less frequently selected reasons\u2014such
        as a lack of relevant data or difficulties finding data\u2014indicate that
        perhaps some people may have tried to reuse data previously. I bring this
        up as I think it is important to remember that this variation in practice
        exists, that not everyone is a re-user of data, and that other ways of conducting
        research are also valuable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q6.
        <strong>What are your most interesting or surprising findings?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps
        most surprising to me at a high level was how much our data had to say about
        the practices of SSH researchers. We found that SSH researchers are the only
        disciplinary groups who prefer that others cite or mention their own data,
        as opposed to other data objects (e.g. an article or a collection of data).
        This contrasts <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23529\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">past scientometric work</a>
        showing that SSH scholars cite \u2018data studies,\u2019 rather than individual
        data files.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We were also able to identify unique differences
        between social scientists and humanities scholars, such as the tendency for
        humanities scholars to integrate data more than most other disciplinary groups
        or the pattern of social scientists to refer to related publications (rather
        than data) less than other groups.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div style=\\\"height:30px\\\"

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Q7. <strong>Why is your study important?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        data also show that most researchers who are citing data (in any way) report
        doing so for reasons in line with responsibly conducting research. This suggests
        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their
        communities and their own ethical principles. If this is the case, the questions
        I see which we need to consider are: When (and how) do we meet researchers
        where they are? When should their research practice be adapted to current
        technical requirements and our own recommendations for data citation, and
        when should those requirements and recommendations be adapted to reflect researchers\u2019
        actual practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\u2019s an important reminder that we
        need to take our time and involve research communities in the development
        of policies and systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>To stay up to date

        place in Aguascalientes, Mexico from October 17th to October 20th 2023 where
        it was hosted by the Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes. The <a href=\\\"https://www.ggbn.org/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">GGBN</a> is a global
        network of collections of genomic samples from across the Tree of Life, whose
        mission is to foster collaborations among biodiversity and biobanking repositories
        in order to ensure quality standards and harmonise exchange of material in
        accordance with national and international legislation and conventions. GigaScience
        Press Data Scientist Chris Armit attended the conference and reports below
        on some of the highlights.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Confronting
        the Global Decline in Biodiversity: The GGBN Perspective</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Oliver
        Ryder </strong>(San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance IUCN-SSC Animal Biobanking
        for Conservation Specialist Group, and <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1186/2047-217X-3-32\\\"

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">standards</a>) introduced
        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN
        Secretariat hosted and supported by the National Museum of Natural History,
        Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC \u2013 aims to provide the necessary

        Ryder\u2019s keynote talk set the stage for Animal Biobanking for Conservation.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus
        przewalskii</em></a><em> </em>was foaled on August 6th 2020 and was named
        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells
        from Willa, a black-footed female ferret who died in the 1980s and who had
        no living descendants.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image is-resized\\\"><img

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate
        functioning iPSCs from frozen cell lines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        toolkit, and some of the challenges for conservation.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>From Fieldwork to BioBank</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Whereas
        there was clear focus on BioBanking at the GGBN conference, I was additionally
        interested to hear that GGBN standards are useful from a rewilding perspective.
        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental
        specimen metadata is used for decision making in projects such as the <a href=\\\"https://bethkaplin.org/current-projects/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">rewilding of Akagera
        National Park</a>. In this project \u2013 which is funded by the National
        Geographic Society \u2013 eDNA sampling of sediment cores and sample surface
        sediments are combined with natural history observations, and used to understand
        biodiversity patterns and assist park management in their plan for reintroductions.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        <a href=\\\"https://www.cbd.int/abs/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\">Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-sharing</a> became effective
        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.
        As Jocelyn explained, \u201Cthe heart of the Nagoya protocol is community
        consent \u2013 informed consent from indigenous people\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        place in Aguascalientes, Mexico from October 17th to October 20th 2023 where
        it was hosted by the Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes. The <a href=\\\"https://www.ggbn.org/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">GGBN</a> is a global
        network of collections of genomic samples from across the Tree of Life, whose
        mission is to foster collaborations among biodiversity and biobanking repositories
        in order to ensure quality standards and harmonise exchange of material in
        accordance with national and international legislation and conventions. GigaScience
        Press Data Scientist Chris Armit attended the conference and reports below
        on some of the highlights.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Confronting
        the Global Decline in Biodiversity: The GGBN Perspective</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Oliver
        Ryder </strong>(San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance IUCN-SSC Animal Biobanking
        for Conservation Specialist Group, and <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1186/2047-217X-3-32\\\"

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">standards</a>) introduced
        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN
        Secretariat hosted and supported by the National Museum of Natural History,
        Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC \u2013 aims to provide the necessary

        Ryder\u2019s keynote talk set the stage for Animal Biobanking for Conservation.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus
        przewalskii</em></a><em> </em>was foaled on August 6th 2020 and was named
        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells
        from Willa, a black-footed female ferret who died in the 1980s and who had
        no living descendants.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image is-resized\\\"><img

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate
        functioning iPSCs from frozen cell lines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        toolkit, and some of the challenges for conservation.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>From Fieldwork to BioBank</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Whereas
        there was clear focus on BioBanking at the GGBN conference, I was additionally
        interested to hear that GGBN standards are useful from a rewilding perspective.
        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental
        specimen metadata is used for decision making in projects such as the <a href=\\\"https://bethkaplin.org/current-projects/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">rewilding of Akagera
        National Park</a>. In this project \u2013 which is funded by the National
        Geographic Society \u2013 eDNA sampling of sediment cores and sample surface
        sediments are combined with natural history observations, and used to understand
        biodiversity patterns and assist park management in their plan for reintroductions.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        <a href=\\\"https://www.cbd.int/abs/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\">Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-sharing</a> became effective
        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.
        As Jocelyn explained, \u201Cthe heart of the Nagoya protocol is community
        consent \u2013 informed consent from indigenous people\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        makes the consolidation even more extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers
        went from 47% of the market in 2000 to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest
        publishers from 54% to controlling 83% of the corpus.</p>\\n<cite>https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/10/30/quantifying-consolidation-in-the-scholarly-journals-market/</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s
        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access
        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such
        policies. The whole system rests on this logic of extraction and that&#8217;s

        have to be creative in order to educate about OA issues. Part of what I suspect

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im Bereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen betont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und Finanzierungsmodellen, die weder
        die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen finanziell belasten und sich durch angemessene
        und transparente Preise auszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird beklagt, dass die steigenden
        Preise f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Fachinformationen zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren
        und die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil der Forschung belasten
        (Punkt 5).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Aufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen Verlagswesen
        wird in zwei bemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung von nicht gewinnorientierten
        Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe Council
        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article
        processing charges or similar per-unit charges and stresses the importance
        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [&#8230;] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers
        are limited in their choice of publication channels due to financial capacities
        rather than quality criteria, and where access to research publications is
        restricted by paywalls\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zwar sind diese Unterstreichung
        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung
        eines pluralistischen, transparenten und nachhaltigen Systems der digtialen
        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die
        Kritik an dem Modell der Publikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Erst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den USA, als
        Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker Einrichtungen, das APC-Modell<a
        href=\\\"https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/\\\">
        deutlich kritisiert</a>. Die Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        Ungleichheit f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut ausgestatteten
        Regionen beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt werden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch hat der
        \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5\\\">R\xFCcktritt</a>
        des Editorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender
        APCs den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die zur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues Journal <a href=\\\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/\\\">gegr\xFCndet</a>,
        das niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das Problem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Um
        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,
        soll die Koordinierung innerhalb der EU und mit globalen Partnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung
        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt
        werden, um die Anzahl von not-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly
        publishing models in Europe with no costs for authors or readers&#8221; signifikant
        zu erh\xF6hen (Absatz 11).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch soll das Anliegen durch
        eine m\xF6gliche Beteiligung der EU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe
        (ORE), der von der EU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr
        Autor:innen aus den EU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        der <a href=\\\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/\\\">Pressemitteilung</a>
        werden weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen augegriffen:&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CSome
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into their national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly publications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national open access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications immediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions acknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like within the framework of the European Open
        Science Cloud (EOSC), and suggest including open science monitoring in the
        European Research Area monitoring mechanism.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Die Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer Tr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu begr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote
        und -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder gemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig zu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf internationaler
        Ebene zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Daf\xFCr sind, wie das Papier richtig
        betont, abgestimmte F\xF6rderaktivit\xE4ten erforderlich, die beispielsweise
        in Deutschland, komplement\xE4r zu DEAL, dem wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizieren
        einen deutlichen Aufschwung geben.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/kz04m-s8z58\",\"guid\":\"https://wisspub.net/?p=20455\",\"id\":\"1c578558-1324-4493-b8af-84c49eabc52f\",\"image\":\"https://wisspub.files.wordpress.com/2023/05/bildschirmc2adfoto-2023-05-23-um-11.05.39.png?w=723\",\"language\":\"de\",\"published_at\":1684833413,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"Die

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im Bereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen betont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und Finanzierungsmodellen, die weder
        die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen finanziell belasten und sich durch angemessene
        und transparente Preise auszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird beklagt, dass die steigenden
        Preise f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Fachinformationen zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren
        und die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil der Forschung belasten
        (Punkt 5).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Aufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen Verlagswesen
        wird in zwei bemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung von nicht gewinnorientierten
        Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe Council
        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article
        processing charges or similar per-unit charges and stresses the importance
        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [&#8230;] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers
        are limited in their choice of publication channels due to financial capacities
        rather than quality criteria, and where access to research publications is
        restricted by paywalls\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zwar sind diese Unterstreichung
        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung
        eines pluralistischen, transparenten und nachhaltigen Systems der digtialen
        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die
        Kritik an dem Modell der Publikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Erst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den USA, als
        Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker Einrichtungen, das APC-Modell<a
        href=\\\"https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/\\\">
        deutlich kritisiert</a>. Die Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        Ungleichheit f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut ausgestatteten
        Regionen beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt werden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch hat der
        \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5\\\">R\xFCcktritt</a>
        des Editorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender
        APCs den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die zur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues Journal <a href=\\\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/\\\">gegr\xFCndet</a>,
        das niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das Problem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Um
        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,
        soll die Koordinierung innerhalb der EU und mit globalen Partnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung
        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt
        werden, um die Anzahl von not-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly
        publishing models in Europe with no costs for authors or readers&#8221; signifikant
        zu erh\xF6hen (Absatz 11).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch soll das Anliegen durch
        eine m\xF6gliche Beteiligung der EU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe
        (ORE), der von der EU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr
        Autor:innen aus den EU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        der <a href=\\\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/\\\">Pressemitteilung</a>
        werden weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen augegriffen:&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CSome
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into their national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly publications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national open access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications immediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions acknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like within the framework of the European Open
        Science Cloud (EOSC), and suggest including open science monitoring in the
        European Research Area monitoring mechanism.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Die Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer Tr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu begr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote
        und -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder gemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig zu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf internationaler
        Ebene zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Daf\xFCr sind, wie das Papier richtig
        betont, abgestimmte F\xF6rderaktivit\xE4ten erforderlich, die beispielsweise
        in Deutschland, komplement\xE4r zu DEAL, dem wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizieren
        einen deutlichen Aufschwung geben.</p>\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/kz04m-s8z58\",\"reference\":[],\"summary\":\"Die

        Small: Community-Owned Futures for Open Access Books\u201D</a>,</strong> April
        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely

        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial

        thing that spurred me to join is a rather unsatisfactory experience I had
        as a peer-reviewer, reviewing a manuscript where the experimental design was
        deeply insufficient. I won&#8217;t reveal for which open access journal I
        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,
        and <em>PCI Registered Reports</em> is one of the communities that will provide
        that service for you, for free! </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would love to see more
        stage 1 registered reports in metaresearch, to catch improperly designed studies
        before they get carried out, written-up, and submitted. Reducing research
        waste AND increasing the quality of research that ends-up getting published
        &#8212; what&#8217;s not to like? It might save you a lot of anguish.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/dy0m6-g3170\",\"guid\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2278\",\"id\":\"fb067113-7046-4cfc-8a1b-a8cf6246eaef\",\"image\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.png\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1700434867,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"This

        thing that spurred me to join is a rather unsatisfactory experience I had
        as a peer-reviewer, reviewing a manuscript where the experimental design was
        deeply insufficient. I won&#8217;t reveal for which open access journal I
        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,
        and <em>PCI Registered Reports</em> is one of the communities that will provide
        that service for you, for free! </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would love to see more
        stage 1 registered reports in metaresearch, to catch improperly designed studies
        before they get carried out, written-up, and submitted. Reducing research
        waste AND increasing the quality of research that ends-up getting published
        &#8212; what&#8217;s not to like? It might save you a lot of anguish.</p>\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/dy0m6-g3170\",\"reference\":[],\"summary\":\"This

        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the

        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus

        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental

        noopener\\\">Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-sharing</a> became effective
        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.
        As Jocelyn explained, \u201Cthe heart of the Nagoya protocol is community
        consent \u2013 informed consent from indigenous people\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        the Global Decline in Biodiversity: The GGBN Perspective</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Oliver
        Ryder </strong>(San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance IUCN-SSC Animal Biobanking

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">standards</a>) introduced
        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus
        przewalskii</em></a><em> </em>was foaled on August 6th 2020 and was named
        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells
        from Willa, a black-footed female ferret who died in the 1980s and who had
        no living descendants.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image is-resized\\\"><img

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate
        functioning iPSCs from frozen cell lines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        there was clear focus on BioBanking at the GGBN conference, I was additionally
        interested to hear that GGBN standards are useful from a rewilding perspective.
        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental
        specimen metadata is used for decision making in projects such as the <a href=\\\"https://bethkaplin.org/current-projects/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">rewilding of Akagera

        noopener\\\">Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-sharing</a> became effective
        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.
        As Jocelyn explained, \u201Cthe heart of the Nagoya protocol is community
        consent \u2013 informed consent from indigenous people\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        makes the consolidation even more extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers
        went from 47% of the market in 2000 to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest

        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access
        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such
        policies. The whole system rests on this logic of extraction and that&#8217;s

        Publikationswesens befasst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bereits im Vorfeld der Sitzung
        der Wissenschaftsministerien wurden verschiedene Versionen der Erkl\xE4rung
        \xF6ffentlich diskutiert (siehe z.B.<a href=\\\"https://sciencebusiness.net/news/Universities/leaked-eu-member-states-set-out-reform-scientific-publishing\\\">
        Science Business</a> und<a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/can-eu-make-parallel-publishing-system-work\\\">
        Times Higher Education</a>). Im Kern stand die Frage, inwiefern das EU-Papier
        den Fokus auf Finanzierungs- und Gesch\xE4ftsmodelle abseits von Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        (Article Processing Charges, APCs) legt und ob sogar eine Abkehr von der Unterst\xFCtzung
        dieses Modells durch die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa betont wird.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Schweden
        hatte das Thema im Rahmen seiner EU-Ratspr\xE4sidentschaft augegriffen und
        bereits im <a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2023/02/10/eu-wissenschaftsministerien-erortern-open-science/\\\">Februar</a>
        in einem Hintergrund-Papier adressiert. Schon in diesem Briefing Paper wurde
        die Problematik steigender Preise f\xFCr die wissenschaftlichen Fachinformation
        betont.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In der jetzt verabschiedeten Version der Schlussfolgerungen
        die Forderung nach sofortigem Open Access f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Publikationen,
        die im Rahmen der \xF6ffentlich gef\xF6rderten Forschung entstehen, nochmals
        betont. Dieses Ziel wurde<a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2016/05/27/eu-und-g7-staaten-setzen-auf-open-science/\\\">
        bereits 2016</a> von den EU-Wissenschaftsministerien erhoben. Die Wissenschaftsminister:innen
        hatten damals einen Open-Access-Anteil von 100 % bis 2020 gefordert. Dieser
        Wert wurde bisher jedoch nicht erreicht. In Deutschland liegt der Open-Access-Anteil
        zum Beispiel bei <a href=\\\"https://open-access-monitor.de/\\\">63</a> Prozent,
        w\xE4hrend die Niederlande im Publikationsjahr 2021 einen Anteil von <a href=\\\"https://www.openaccess.nl/en/in-the-netherlands/monitor\\\">82</a>\_Prozent

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im Bereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen betont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und Finanzierungsmodellen, die weder
        die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen finanziell belasten und sich durch angemessene
        und transparente Preise auszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird beklagt, dass die steigenden
        Preise f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Fachinformationen zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren
        und die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil der Forschung belasten
        (Punkt 5).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Aufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen Verlagswesen
        wird in zwei bemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung von nicht gewinnorientierten
        Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe Council
        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article
        processing charges or similar per-unit charges and stresses the importance
        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [&#8230;] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers
        are limited in their choice of publication channels due to financial capacities
        rather than quality criteria, and where access to research publications is
        restricted by paywalls\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zwar sind diese Unterstreichung
        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung
        eines pluralistischen, transparenten und nachhaltigen Systems der digtialen
        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die
        Kritik an dem Modell der Publikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Erst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den USA, als
        Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker Einrichtungen, das APC-Modell<a
        href=\\\"https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/\\\">
        deutlich kritisiert</a>. Die Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        Ungleichheit f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut ausgestatteten
        Regionen beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt werden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch hat der
        \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5\\\">R\xFCcktritt</a>
        des Editorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender
        APCs den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die zur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues Journal <a href=\\\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/\\\">gegr\xFCndet</a>,
        das niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das Problem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Um
        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,
        soll die Koordinierung innerhalb der EU und mit globalen Partnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung
        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt
        werden, um die Anzahl von not-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly
        publishing models in Europe with no costs for authors or readers&#8221; signifikant
        zu erh\xF6hen (Absatz 11).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch soll das Anliegen durch
        eine m\xF6gliche Beteiligung der EU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe
        (ORE), der von der EU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr
        Autor:innen aus den EU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        der <a href=\\\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/\\\">Pressemitteilung</a>
        werden weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen augegriffen:&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CSome
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into their national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly publications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national open access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications immediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions acknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like within the framework of the European Open
        Science Cloud (EOSC), and suggest including open science monitoring in the
        European Research Area monitoring mechanism.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Die Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer Tr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu begr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote
        und -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder gemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig zu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf internationaler
        Ebene zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Daf\xFCr sind, wie das Papier richtig

        der deutschen Version</a>)\_mit den aktuellen Herausforderungen des wissenschaftlichen
        Publikationswesens befasst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bereits im Vorfeld der Sitzung
        der Wissenschaftsministerien wurden verschiedene Versionen der Erkl\xE4rung
        \xF6ffentlich diskutiert (siehe z.B.<a href=\\\"https://sciencebusiness.net/news/Universities/leaked-eu-member-states-set-out-reform-scientific-publishing\\\">
        Science Business</a> und<a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/can-eu-make-parallel-publishing-system-work\\\">
        Times Higher Education</a>). Im Kern stand die Frage, inwiefern das EU-Papier
        den Fokus auf Finanzierungs- und Gesch\xE4ftsmodelle abseits von Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        (Article Processing Charges, APCs) legt und ob sogar eine Abkehr von der Unterst\xFCtzung
        dieses Modells durch die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa betont wird.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Schweden
        hatte das Thema im Rahmen seiner EU-Ratspr\xE4sidentschaft augegriffen und
        bereits im <a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2023/02/10/eu-wissenschaftsministerien-erortern-open-science/\\\">Februar</a>
        in einem Hintergrund-Papier adressiert. Schon in diesem Briefing Paper wurde
        die Problematik steigender Preise f\xFCr die wissenschaftlichen Fachinformation
        betont.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In der jetzt verabschiedeten Version der Schlussfolgerungen
        die Forderung nach sofortigem Open Access f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Publikationen,
        die im Rahmen der \xF6ffentlich gef\xF6rderten Forschung entstehen, nochmals
        betont. Dieses Ziel wurde<a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2016/05/27/eu-und-g7-staaten-setzen-auf-open-science/\\\">
        bereits 2016</a> von den EU-Wissenschaftsministerien erhoben. Die Wissenschaftsminister:innen
        hatten damals einen Open-Access-Anteil von 100 % bis 2020 gefordert. Dieser
        Wert wurde bisher jedoch nicht erreicht. In Deutschland liegt der Open-Access-Anteil
        zum Beispiel bei <a href=\\\"https://open-access-monitor.de/\\\">63</a> Prozent,
        w\xE4hrend die Niederlande im Publikationsjahr 2021 einen Anteil von <a href=\\\"https://www.openaccess.nl/en/in-the-netherlands/monitor\\\">82</a>\_Prozent

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im Bereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen betont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und Finanzierungsmodellen, die weder
        die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen finanziell belasten und sich durch angemessene
        und transparente Preise auszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird beklagt, dass die steigenden
        Preise f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Fachinformationen zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren
        und die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil der Forschung belasten
        (Punkt 5).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Aufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen Verlagswesen
        wird in zwei bemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung von nicht gewinnorientierten
        Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe Council
        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article
        processing charges or similar per-unit charges and stresses the importance
        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [&#8230;] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers
        are limited in their choice of publication channels due to financial capacities
        rather than quality criteria, and where access to research publications is
        restricted by paywalls\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zwar sind diese Unterstreichung
        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung
        eines pluralistischen, transparenten und nachhaltigen Systems der digtialen
        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die
        Kritik an dem Modell der Publikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Erst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den USA, als
        Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker Einrichtungen, das APC-Modell<a
        href=\\\"https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/\\\">
        deutlich kritisiert</a>. Die Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        Ungleichheit f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut ausgestatteten
        Regionen beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt werden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch hat der
        \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5\\\">R\xFCcktritt</a>
        des Editorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender
        APCs den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die zur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues Journal <a href=\\\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/\\\">gegr\xFCndet</a>,
        das niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das Problem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Um
        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,
        soll die Koordinierung innerhalb der EU und mit globalen Partnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung
        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt
        werden, um die Anzahl von not-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly
        publishing models in Europe with no costs for authors or readers&#8221; signifikant
        zu erh\xF6hen (Absatz 11).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch soll das Anliegen durch
        eine m\xF6gliche Beteiligung der EU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe
        (ORE), der von der EU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr
        Autor:innen aus den EU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        der <a href=\\\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/\\\">Pressemitteilung</a>
        werden weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen augegriffen:&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CSome
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into their national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly publications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national open access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications immediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions acknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like within the framework of the European Open
        Science Cloud (EOSC), and suggest including open science monitoring in the
        European Research Area monitoring mechanism.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Die Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer Tr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu begr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote
        und -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder gemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig zu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf internationaler
        Ebene zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Daf\xFCr sind, wie das Papier richtig
        betont, abgestimmte F\xF6rderaktivit\xE4ten erforderlich, die beispielsweise
        in Deutschland, komplement\xE4r zu DEAL, dem wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizieren
        einen deutlichen Aufschwung geben.</p>\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/kz04m-s8z58\",\"reference\":[],\"summary\":\"Die

        Small: Community-Owned Futures for Open Access Books\u201D</a>,</strong> April
        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        place in Aguascalientes, Mexico from October 17th to October 20th 2023 where
        it was hosted by the Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes. The <a href=\\\"https://www.ggbn.org/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">GGBN</a> is a global
        network of collections of genomic samples from across the Tree of Life, whose
        mission is to foster collaborations among biodiversity and biobanking repositories
        in order to ensure quality standards and harmonise exchange of material in
        accordance with national and international legislation and conventions. GigaScience
        Press Data Scientist Chris Armit attended the conference and reports below
        on some of the highlights.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Confronting
        the Global Decline in Biodiversity: The GGBN Perspective</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Oliver
        Ryder </strong>(San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance IUCN-SSC Animal Biobanking
        for Conservation Specialist Group, and <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1186/2047-217X-3-32\\\"

        \u2013 of which we have published many genomes and <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1186/2047-217X-1-8\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">standards</a>) introduced
        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN
        Secretariat hosted and supported by the National Museum of Natural History,
        Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC \u2013 aims to provide the necessary

        Ryder\u2019s keynote talk set the stage for Animal Biobanking for Conservation.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">first cloned <em>Equus
        przewalskii</em></a><em> </em>was foaled on August 6th 2020 and was named
        \u2018Kurt\u2019 in honour of the first Frozen Zoo creator Dr Kurt Benirschke
        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered
        species to be cloned</a>. Elizabeth Ann was cloned using the frozen cells
        from Willa, a black-footed female ferret who died in the 1980s and who had
        no living descendants.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image is-resized\\\"><img

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.
        As Jocelyn explained, \u201Cthe heart of the Nagoya protocol is community

        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the

        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks

        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"

        of San Diego Zoo.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same year, a black-footed ferret
        named \u2018Elizabeth Ann\u2019 (born December 10, 2020) was <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">the first U.S. endangered

        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.

        makes the consolidation even more extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers
        went from 47% of the market in 2000 to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest

        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays

        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such

        processes and supports within an institution can, I&#8217;ve noticed, demand
        a bit of effort to change. When we speak of <strong>open scholarship</strong>
        or <strong>open science</strong>, many aspects tie-in or lead out from those
        concepts, which makes the whole prospect of institutional change quite complex.
        I&#8217;m very excited about the efforts so far that the Open Science Working
        Group (of which I&#8217;m a participant) at Concordia University has undertaken
        and accomplished. These include an initial report on &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.11573/spectrum.library.concordia.ca.00992647\\\"><strong>Recommendations

        course, the Library is always doing outreach about open access (OA). In the
        past I&#8217;ve organized activities, events, and <a href=\\\"https://chroknowlogy.ca/intellectual-liberty/2022/talk-broad-value-open-access/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"post\\\" data-id=\\\"64563\\\">projects</a> for <a href=\\\"https://www.openaccessweek.org/\\\">open
        access week</a>. I can see how frequently our modern research practices, which
        involve digital techniques are enabled by the various forms of open: open
        source, open data, open protocols, open access, etc. However, I&#8217;ve always
        found that it&#8217;s a struggle to get people&#8217;s interest and that we
        have to be creative in order to educate about OA issues. Part of what I suspect
        makes advocating for OA difficult is the sort of singularity that comes from
        being &#8220;just the library,&#8221; the group that&#8217;s always talking
        about it. So when this Open Science Working Group formed, I was excited about
        its multidisciplinary nature and that it included both students and faculty.
        I think that really helps to broaden involvement across the university.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        working group, led by colleagues Krista Byers-Heinlein (who is also Concordia
        University Research Chair in Bilingualism and Open Science) and Nicol\xE1s
        Alessandroni, initiated the effort through a day-long <a href=\\\"https://www.concordia.ca/cuevents/artsci/2022/05/27/open-science-concordia.html\\\">conference
        on open science</a> in 2022. Later they established the working group by inviting
        people to participate in a workshop (there were over 20 people representing
        many disciplines). The workshop operated through a modified form of DORA&#8217;s
        <a href=\\\"https://sfdora.org/resource/workshop-toolkit-to-introduce-the-space-rubric/\\\">SPACE
        rubric</a>, which was designed for academic institutions to use toward improving
        their policies. I think using that tool to organize such a large group of
        people toward a practical outcome was extremely beneficial. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        more meetings, discussions, and revisions the working group was able to produce
        a set of <a href=\\\"https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/id/eprint/992647/\\\">recommendations</a>
        to bolster open scholarship throughout the university. It addresses many issues,
        including existing policies, outreach, inter-institutional work, position
        principles, open education, resources, and more. Of course, this is not the
        end of the process. Among other things, next steps include focused discussions
        with department heads, administrators, and others. I imagine that getting

        institution can, I&#8217;ve noticed, demand a bit of effort to change. When
        we speak of <strong>open scholarship</strong> or <strong>open science</strong>,
        many aspects tie-in or lead out from those concepts, which makes the whole
        prospect of institutional change quite complex. I&#8217;m very excited about
        the efforts so far that the Open Science Working Group (of which I&#8217;m
        a participant) at Concordia University has undertaken and accomplished. These
        include an initial report on &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.11573/spectrum.library.concordia.ca.00992647\\\"><strong>Recommendations
        for Fostering Open Science at Concordia University</strong></a>&#8221; (DOI:
        10.11573/spectrum.library.concordia.ca.00992647) </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<!--more-->\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        course, the Library is always doing outreach about open access (OA). In the
        past I&#8217;ve organized activities, events, and <a href=\\\"https://chroknowlogy.ca/intellectual-liberty/2022/talk-broad-value-open-access/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"post\\\" data-id=\\\"64563\\\">projects</a> for <a href=\\\"https://www.openaccessweek.org/\\\">open
        access week</a>. I can see how frequently our modern research practices, which
        involve digital techniques are enabled by the various forms of open: open
        source, open data, open protocols, open access, etc. However, I&#8217;ve always
        found that it&#8217;s a struggle to get people&#8217;s interest and that we
        have to be creative in order to educate about OA issues. Part of what I suspect
        makes advocating for OA difficult is the sort of singularity that comes from
        being &#8220;just the library,&#8221; the group that&#8217;s always talking
        about it. So when this Open Science Working Group formed, I was excited about
        its multidisciplinary nature and that it included both students and faculty.
        I think that really helps to broaden involvement across the university.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        working group, led by colleagues Krista Byers-Heinlein (who is also Concordia
        University Research Chair in Bilingualism and Open Science) and Nicol\xE1s
        Alessandroni, initiated the effort through a day-long <a href=\\\"https://www.concordia.ca/cuevents/artsci/2022/05/27/open-science-concordia.html\\\">conference
        on open science</a> in 2022. Later they established the working group by inviting
        people to participate in a workshop (there were over 20 people representing
        many disciplines). The workshop operated through a modified form of DORA&#8217;s
        <a href=\\\"https://sfdora.org/resource/workshop-toolkit-to-introduce-the-space-rubric/\\\">SPACE
        rubric</a>, which was designed for academic institutions to use toward improving
        their policies. I think using that tool to organize such a large group of
        people toward a practical outcome was extremely beneficial. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        more meetings, discussions, and revisions the working group was able to produce
        a set of <a href=\\\"https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/id/eprint/992647/\\\">recommendations</a>
        to bolster open scholarship throughout the university. It addresses many issues,
        including existing policies, outreach, inter-institutional work, position
        principles, open education, resources, and more. Of course, this is not the
        end of the process. Among other things, next steps include focused discussions
        with department heads, administrators, and others. I imagine that getting
        to a place where open scholarship/open science is well-understood and hopefully
        a default institutional position for research and education will require ongoing
        work. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The recommendations in the report tend to be specific
        within the context of Concordia University but I felt it worthwhile to write

        der deutschen Version</a>)\_mit den aktuellen Herausforderungen des wissenschaftlichen
        Publikationswesens befasst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bereits im Vorfeld der Sitzung
        der Wissenschaftsministerien wurden verschiedene Versionen der Erkl\xE4rung
        \xF6ffentlich diskutiert (siehe z.B.<a href=\\\"https://sciencebusiness.net/news/Universities/leaked-eu-member-states-set-out-reform-scientific-publishing\\\">
        Science Business</a> und<a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/can-eu-make-parallel-publishing-system-work\\\">
        Times Higher Education</a>). Im Kern stand die Frage, inwiefern das EU-Papier
        den Fokus auf Finanzierungs- und Gesch\xE4ftsmodelle abseits von Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        (Article Processing Charges, APCs) legt und ob sogar eine Abkehr von der Unterst\xFCtzung
        dieses Modells durch die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa betont wird.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Schweden
        hatte das Thema im Rahmen seiner EU-Ratspr\xE4sidentschaft augegriffen und
        bereits im <a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2023/02/10/eu-wissenschaftsministerien-erortern-open-science/\\\">Februar</a>
        in einem Hintergrund-Papier adressiert. Schon in diesem Briefing Paper wurde
        die Problematik steigender Preise f\xFCr die wissenschaftlichen Fachinformation
        betont.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In der jetzt verabschiedeten Version der Schlussfolgerungen
        die Forderung nach sofortigem Open Access f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Publikationen,
        die im Rahmen der \xF6ffentlich gef\xF6rderten Forschung entstehen, nochmals
        betont. Dieses Ziel wurde<a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2016/05/27/eu-und-g7-staaten-setzen-auf-open-science/\\\">
        bereits 2016</a> von den EU-Wissenschaftsministerien erhoben. Die Wissenschaftsminister:innen
        hatten damals einen Open-Access-Anteil von 100 % bis 2020 gefordert. Dieser
        Wert wurde bisher jedoch nicht erreicht. In Deutschland liegt der Open-Access-Anteil
        zum Beispiel bei <a href=\\\"https://open-access-monitor.de/\\\">63</a> Prozent,
        w\xE4hrend die Niederlande im Publikationsjahr 2021 einen Anteil von <a href=\\\"https://www.openaccess.nl/en/in-the-netherlands/monitor\\\">82</a>\_Prozent

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im Bereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen betont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und Finanzierungsmodellen, die weder
        die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen finanziell belasten und sich durch angemessene
        und transparente Preise auszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird beklagt, dass die steigenden
        Preise f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Fachinformationen zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren
        und die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil der Forschung belasten

        Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe Council
        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article
        processing charges or similar per-unit charges and stresses the importance
        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [&#8230;] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers
        are limited in their choice of publication channels due to financial capacities
        rather than quality criteria, and where access to research publications is
        restricted by paywalls\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zwar sind diese Unterstreichung
        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung
        eines pluralistischen, transparenten und nachhaltigen Systems der digtialen
        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die
        Kritik an dem Modell der Publikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Erst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den USA, als

        href=\\\"https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/\\\">
        deutlich kritisiert</a>. Die Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        Ungleichheit f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut ausgestatteten
        Regionen beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt werden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch hat der

        des Editorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender
        APCs den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die zur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues Journal <a href=\\\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/\\\">gegr\xFCndet</a>,
        das niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das Problem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Um
        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,
        soll die Koordinierung innerhalb der EU und mit globalen Partnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung
        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt
        werden, um die Anzahl von not-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly
        publishing models in Europe with no costs for authors or readers&#8221; signifikant
        zu erh\xF6hen (Absatz 11).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch soll das Anliegen durch
        eine m\xF6gliche Beteiligung der EU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe
        (ORE), der von der EU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr

        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into their national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly publications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national open access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications immediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions acknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like within the framework of the European Open

        der Wissenschaftsministerien wurden verschiedene Versionen der Erkl\xE4rung
        \xF6ffentlich diskutiert (siehe z.B.<a href=\\\"https://sciencebusiness.net/news/Universities/leaked-eu-member-states-set-out-reform-scientific-publishing\\\">
        Science Business</a> und<a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/can-eu-make-parallel-publishing-system-work\\\">
        Times Higher Education</a>). Im Kern stand die Frage, inwiefern das EU-Papier
        den Fokus auf Finanzierungs- und Gesch\xE4ftsmodelle abseits von Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        (Article Processing Charges, APCs) legt und ob sogar eine Abkehr von der Unterst\xFCtzung
        dieses Modells durch die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa betont wird.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Schweden
        hatte das Thema im Rahmen seiner EU-Ratspr\xE4sidentschaft augegriffen und
        bereits im <a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2023/02/10/eu-wissenschaftsministerien-erortern-open-science/\\\">Februar</a>
        in einem Hintergrund-Papier adressiert. Schon in diesem Briefing Paper wurde
        die Problematik steigender Preise f\xFCr die wissenschaftlichen Fachinformation
        betont.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In der jetzt verabschiedeten Version der Schlussfolgerungen
        die Forderung nach sofortigem Open Access f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Publikationen,
        die im Rahmen der \xF6ffentlich gef\xF6rderten Forschung entstehen, nochmals
        betont. Dieses Ziel wurde<a href=\\\"https://wisspub.net/2016/05/27/eu-und-g7-staaten-setzen-auf-open-science/\\\">
        bereits 2016</a> von den EU-Wissenschaftsministerien erhoben. Die Wissenschaftsminister:innen
        hatten damals einen Open-Access-Anteil von 100 % bis 2020 gefordert. Dieser
        Wert wurde bisher jedoch nicht erreicht. In Deutschland liegt der Open-Access-Anteil
        zum Beispiel bei <a href=\\\"https://open-access-monitor.de/\\\">63</a> Prozent,
        w\xE4hrend die Niederlande im Publikationsjahr 2021 einen Anteil von <a href=\\\"https://www.openaccess.nl/en/in-the-netherlands/monitor\\\">82</a>\_Prozent

        Small: Community-Owned Futures for Open Access Books\u201D</a>,</strong> April
        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        the Global Decline in Biodiversity: The GGBN Perspective</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Oliver
        Ryder </strong>(San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance IUCN-SSC Animal Biobanking
        for Conservation Specialist Group, and <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1186/2047-217X-3-32\\\"

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">standards</a>) introduced
        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America
        and the Caribbean showing a staggering 94% reduction in biodiversity. The
        message is clear \u2013 we have to act now to conserve our living planet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Conservation
        is a key focus of the GGBN, and this network \u2013 coordinated by the GGBN

        term \u2018Data Standards\u2019 is used to describe a set of terms and controlled
        vocabularies designed to represent facts about a sample/voucher. An additional
        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen
        and which can include genomic sequence data and metabolomics data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>One Plan Approach</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the
        Secretariat and professional societies to promote integration of <em>in situ</em>
        and <em>ex situ</em> conservation interventions\u201D and \u201Cto ensure
        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks
        dedicated to the achievement of global species conservation targets and operating
        to common standards of good practice and information sharing.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3
        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has
        been used for the critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/the-story-of-a-colt-named-kurt/\\\"

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Scalability of Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben
        Novak</strong> of Revive & Restore (Sausalito, California), in his talk entitled
        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted
        chromosome</a> \u2013 known as an accessory chromosome \u2013 that is present
        in the oocytes and spermatocytes, and is subsequently <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-005-0025-5\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a
        href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate
        functioning iPSCs from frozen cell lines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the
        cryopreservation of endangered species. The alternative is to cryopreserve
        reproductive tissues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Cryopreservation
        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing
        and regenerating reproductive cells and cell lines from endangered animal
        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        there was clear focus on BioBanking at the GGBN conference, I was additionally
        interested to hear that GGBN standards are useful from a rewilding perspective.
        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural
        Resource Management, University of Rwanda) offered some invaluable insights
        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental
        specimen metadata is used for decision making in projects such as the <a href=\\\"https://bethkaplin.org/current-projects/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">rewilding of Akagera

        in 2014. It is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits
        arising from the utilisation of genetic resources in a fair and equitable
        way. One of the key features of the Nagoya Protocol agreement is that a permit
        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,
        <strong>Jocelyn Che\xE9-Santiago</strong> (Universidad Aut\xF3noma de Aguascalientes)
        focused on the Nagoya Protocol as it relates to Mexico and explained, \u201Cyou
        need to get a permit of collect\u201D. One of the reasons for a permit is
        to ensure the recognition of the collective property of indigenous lands,
        and to ensure that allegations of biopiracy are excluded from genomic collections.
        As Jocelyn explained, \u201Cthe heart of the Nagoya protocol is community
        consent \u2013 informed consent from indigenous people\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        the Biodiversity Crisis with some dizzying statistics. A study of 31,821 populations
        representing 5,230 species monitored across the globe showed a 69% decline
        in abundance. The decline is disproportionate across the globe with the megadiverse
        continent of Africa showing a 66% reduction in biodiversity, and Latin America

        important concept pertinent to the focus of GGBN is the \u201CDigital Extended
        Specimen\u201D, which is a cloud of information around a vouchered specimen

        his Keynote talk, Oliver Ryder highlighted the need for a common standard
        of good practice and information sharing. Towards this end, Oliver showcased
        the \u201COne Plan Approach\u201D which was formulated at the IUCN World Conservation
        Congress 2020 at its session in Marseille, France, and which \u201Curges the

        effective use of all available conservation tools\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of
        central importance for this network, are the calls on IUCN Commissions and
        Members to \u201Cenable and support establishment of a global network of biobanks

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Genetic Rescue and Cloning</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Oliver
        Ryder further showcased a series of success stories. Foremost amongst these
        is genetic rescue by moving animals. Genetic rescue involves an increase in
        fitness from the introduction of new, unrelated individuals into small, declining
        populations, and we have <a href=\\\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/honeyeater-genome/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">explored this topic
        previously</a> with our publication of the genome of the critically endangered
        helmeted honeyeater. At GGBN 2023, Oliver highlighted how genetic rescue has
        been successful in <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130300.htm\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">increasing the fitness
        of the Florida panther</a> <em>Puma</em> <em>concolor coryi</em>, by moving
        female panthers from Texas to Florida from the mid-1990s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much
        more technically challenging is the use of cloning to increase genetic fitness
        in endangered species. Oliver was swift to point out that this approach has

        and the Frozen Zoo</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A core focus of the GGBN conference
        was cryobanking of viable cells and gametes. In her talk on Biodiversity Biobanking,
        <strong>Jackie Mackenzie-Dodds</strong> (Natural History Museum, London) referred
        to the cryopreservation facilities as a \u201Ctreasure trove of molecules\u201D.
        Jackie pointed out that viable cell lines are the most requested resource
        for the Natural History Museum BioBank, where they are used for the generation
        of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and chimaeras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        important message from the GGBN conference was the need for Open Access BioBank
        facilities. Towards this end, an additional incentive for researchers and
        curators was provided by <strong>Mudzuli Mavhunga</strong> of Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria).
        Mudzuli highlighted that, if a South African BioBank is awarded the status
        of Open Access, then it is eligible for resource allocations through Biodiversity
        Biobanks South Africa (BBSA), which is a great asset for a collection facility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        is cloning from frozen somatic cell lines a scalable approach? <strong>Ben

        \u201CImportant Considerations for Biobanking for Genetic Rescue of Endangered
        Species\u201D, highlighted the example of passerines (perching birds) where
        programmed DNA loss is observed in some species. In passerines such as the
        zebra finch (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>), there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009234912307\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">germ-line-restricted

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">lost during male meiosis</a>.
        This germ-line restricted chromosome is unusual in that it is represented
        exclusively in the germ cells, and is absent from somatic cells of the <a

        elimination is observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, and can
        occur through chromosome breakage and selective loss of chromosome regions
        and/or the elimination of individual chromosomes. However, this phenomenon,
        if observed in somatic tissues, can severely impact on the ability to generate

        Ben explained, a key consideration for cryobanking is \u201Cwhich tissues
        to save?\u201D. The inclusion of an additional cytogenetics step, to ensure
        a cell line is chosen where the chromosomal integrity is maintained, is one
        means of addressing the challenge of germ-line-restricted chromosomes in the

        for BioBanking of Gametes and Reproductive Tissues</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On
        the subject of cryopreservation of reproductive tissues, invaluable insights
        were provided by <strong>Tullis Matson</strong> of <a href=\\\"https://www.natures-safe.com/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Nature\u2019s SAFE</a>,
        whose mission is to combat extinction by collecting, indefinitely storing

        species.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis has expertise in artificial insemination
        of rare equine breeds, including the critically endangered Suffolk Punch for
        which there are only 300 individuals in the world and only 80 breeding females.
        Tullis has created Nature\u2019s SAFE with the intention of applying this
        know-how of rare equine breeds to endangered mammalian species, and has been
        on field trips to cryopreserve sperm from elephants in South Africa. An important
        message was that the samples that were obtained in South Africa stay in South
        Africa, which is both an ethical and legal obligation (see Sharing of Genomic
        Collections under the Nagoya Protocol below).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tullis additionally
        highlighted the importance of harvesting epididymal samples, and the role
        of Nature\u2019s SAFE in cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from the pied
        tamarin (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, critically endangered), the lar gibbon
        (<em>Hylobates lar</em>, endangered), and the cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>,
        vulnerable). As Tullis explained, \u201Cworking with leading reproductive
        scientists and cryobiologists, we use state-of-the-art methods to preserve
        cells in a way that maintains viability, allowing them to be thawed and used
        to establish pregnancies, restoring endangered animal species\u201D.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3

        <strong>Beth Kaplin</strong> (Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural

        on this topic, and highlighted that environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental

        is required for gathering a specimen. From a GGBN perspective, it is a requirement
        to share this information with GGBN, where it is stored in the Darwin Core
        metadata associated with a sample.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an illustrative example,

        makes the consolidation even more extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers
        went from 47% of the market in 2000 to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest
        publishers from 54% to controlling 83% of the corpus.</p>\\n<cite>https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/10/30/quantifying-consolidation-in-the-scholarly-journals-market/</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s
        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access
        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such
        policies. The whole system rests on this logic of extraction and that&#8217;s
        what needs to be opposed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/z8017-00204\",\"guid\":\"https://www.samuelmoore.org/?p=1437\",\"id\":\"95fef4ed-6274-47ed-a682-494ef1cb85ef\",\"image\":\"https://www.samuelmoore.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/R229.aa364024.jpg\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1698678686,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"Today\u2019s

        83% of the corpus.</p>\\n<cite>https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/10/30/quantifying-consolidation-in-the-scholarly-journals-market/</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s
        helpful to have more data on the increasing power that a small number of academic
        publishers hold. Crotty charts this consolidation from the year 2000 onwards,
        from the concentration brought about by the effects of the Big Deal to the
        present day where 5 publishers now control 61% of the article output, brought
        about by the dominant business models for open access based on greater volume
        and technological scale. The author&#8217;s finger is pointed at Coalition
        S for instigating a &#8216;rapid state of change&#8217; that allows author-pays
        open access to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of open access
        policies, Plan S especially, and I&#8217;m sure that policy interventions
        play a part in the consolidation at play. There are of course many ways of
        achieving open access without recourse to author fees, transformative agreements,
        or technologies that remove human expertise in place of automation and scale.
        But while there is nothing natural or necessary about the relationship between
        open access and consolidation, there is a much stronger connection between
        commercialisation and consolidation. The recent history of academic publishing
        has been of marketisation and, hence, consolidation.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        always bristle when I read that open access is to blame for the problems with
        the publishing market, not simply because open access does not have to be
        a market-based activity (and is better when it isn&#8217;t) but more because
        the explanation is so shallow. It is a position that usually takes as its
        starting point that the natural and proper way for academic publishing to
        be organised is as a commercial activity and any intervention that works against
        this is to blame for the deleterious effects of commercialisation. Publishing
        is and always is a business (possibly a reflection of the constituents that
        the <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> represents), despite the fact that it is exactly
        the commercial nature of publishing that is the problem. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet
        open access is good precisely because it allows us to reorient academic publishing
        away from commercial practice and to experiment with forms of publishing that
        are less reliant on competition, profiteering and the extraction of free and
        under-remunerated labour. Policymakers are starting to wake up to this fact,
        as in part illustrated by the turn towards no-fee and non-commercial forms
        of open access, and I am cautiously optimistic about this turn. The danger
        is that policymakers mandate no-fee open access in accordance with the requirements
        of commercial publishing and the need to devalue skilled labour in the pursuit
        of revenue. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to criticise open access
        policies for their harmful impact, but this has to be done from a position
        that understands how the same issues of profiteering and extraction were a
        consequence of the subscription market too. They are the logical extension
        of publishing as a market-based activity, not of wanting to make the literature
        freely available to all. Open access policies do not address the problem of
        marketisation largely because they are not designed to do so. Profit-seeking
        actors create business models to maximise their revenues as a result of such
        policies. The whole system rests on this logic of extraction and that&#8217;s
        what needs to be opposed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/z8017-00204\",\"reference\":[],\"summary\":\"Today\u2019s

        found that it&#8217;s a struggle to get people&#8217;s interest and that we
        have to be creative in order to educate about OA issues. Part of what I suspect
        makes advocating for OA difficult is the sort of singularity that comes from

        of the European Union [&#8230;] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,

        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung

        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die
        Kritik an dem Modell der Publikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Erst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den USA, als

        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,

        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt

        werden weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen augegriffen:&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CSome
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into their national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly publications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national open access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications immediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions acknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like within the framework of the European Open
        Science Cloud (EOSC), and suggest including open science monitoring in the
        European Research Area monitoring mechanism.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Die Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer Tr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu begr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote
        und -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder gemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig zu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf internationaler
        Ebene zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Daf\xFCr sind, wie das Papier richtig
        betont, abgestimmte F\xF6rderaktivit\xE4ten erforderlich, die beispielsweise
        in Deutschland, komplement\xE4r zu DEAL, dem wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizieren
        einen deutlichen Aufschwung geben.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/kz04m-s8z58\",\"guid\":\"https://wisspub.net/?p=20455\",\"id\":\"1c578558-1324-4493-b8af-84c49eabc52f\",\"image\":\"https://wisspub.files.wordpress.com/2023/05/bildschirmc2adfoto-2023-05-23-um-11.05.39.png?w=723\",\"language\":\"de\",\"published_at\":1684833413,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"Die

        Small: Community-Owned Futures for Open Access Books\u201D</a>,</strong> April
        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,
