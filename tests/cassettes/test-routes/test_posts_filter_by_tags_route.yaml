        I\u2019m very excited about the efforts so far that the Open Science Working
        Group (of which I\u2019m a participant) at Concordia University has undertaken
        and accomplished. These include an initial report on \u201C<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.11573/spectrum.library.concordia.ca.00992647\\\"><strong>Recommendations
        for Fostering Open Science at Concordia University</strong></a>\u201D (DOI:

        course, the Library is always doing outreach about open access (OA). In the
        past I\u2019ve organized activities, events, and <a href=\\\"https://chroknowlogy.ca/intellectual-liberty/2022/talk-broad-value-open-access/\\\">projects</a>
        for <a href=\\\"https://www.openaccessweek.org/\\\">open access week</a>.
        I can see how frequently our modern research practices, which involve digital
        techniques are enabled by the various forms of open: open source, open data,
        open protocols, open access, etc. However, I\u2019ve always found that it\u2019s
        a struggle to get people\u2019s interest and that we have to be creative in
        order to educate about OA issues. Part of what I suspect makes advocating
        for OA difficult is the sort of singularity that comes from being \u201Cjust
        the library,\u201D the group that\u2019s always talking about it. So when
        this Open Science Working Group formed, I was excited about its multidisciplinary
        nature and that it included both students and faculty. I think that really
        helps to broaden involvement across the university.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        working group, led by colleagues Krista Byers-Heinlein (who is also Concordia
        University Research Chair in Bilingualism and Open Science) and Nicol\xE1s
        Alessandroni, initiated the effort through a day-long <a href=\\\"https://www.concordia.ca/cuevents/artsci/2022/05/27/open-science-concordia.html\\\">conference
        on open science</a> in 2022. Later they established the working group by inviting
        people to participate in a workshop (there were over 20 people representing
        many disciplines). The workshop operated through a modified form of DORA\u2019s
        <a href=\\\"https://sfdora.org/resource/workshop-toolkit-to-introduce-the-space-rubric/\\\">SPACE
        rubric</a>, which was designed for academic institutions to use toward improving
        their policies. I think using that tool to organize such a large group of
        people toward a practical outcome was extremely beneficial. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        more meetings, discussions, and revisions the working group was able to produce
        a set of <a href=\\\"https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/id/eprint/992647/\\\">recommendations</a>
        to bolster open scholarship throughout the university. It addresses many issues,
        including existing policies, outreach, inter-institutional work, position
        principles, open education, resources, and more. Of course, this is not the
        end of the process. Among other things, next steps include focused discussions
        with department heads, administrators, and others. I imagine that getting

        a default institutional position for research and education will require ongoing

        within the context of Concordia University but I felt it worthwhile to write

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im Bereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen betont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und Finanzierungsmodellen, die weder
        die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen finanziell belasten und sich durch angemessene
        und transparente Preise auszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird beklagt, dass die steigenden
        Preise f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Fachinformationen zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren
        und die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil der Forschung belasten
        (Punkt 5).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Aufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen Verlagswesen
        wird in zwei bemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung von nicht gewinnorientierten
        Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe Council
        of the European Union [\u2026] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article
        processing charges or similar per-unit charges and stresses the importance
        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [\u2026] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers
        are limited in their choice of publication channels due to financial capacities
        rather than quality criteria, and where access to research publications is
        restricted by paywalls\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zwar sind diese Unterstreichung
        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung
        eines pluralistischen, transparenten und nachhaltigen Systems der digtialen
        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die
        Kritik an dem Modell der Publikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Erst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den USA, als
        Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker Einrichtungen, das APC-Modell<a
        href=\\\"https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/\\\">
        deutlich kritisiert</a>. Die Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        Ungleichheit f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut ausgestatteten
        Regionen beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt werden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch hat der
        \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5\\\">R\xFCcktritt</a>
        des Editorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender
        APCs den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die zur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues Journal <a href=\\\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/\\\">gegr\xFCndet</a>,
        das niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das Problem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Um
        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,
        soll die Koordinierung innerhalb der EU und mit globalen Partnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung
        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt
        werden, um die Anzahl von not-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly
        publishing models in Europe with no costs for authors or readers\u201D signifikant
        zu erh\xF6hen (Absatz 11).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch soll das Anliegen durch
        eine m\xF6gliche Beteiligung der EU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe
        (ORE), der von der EU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr
        Autor:innen aus den EU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        der <a href=\\\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/\\\">Pressemitteilung</a>
        werden weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen augegriffen:\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CSome
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into their national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly publications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national open access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications immediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions acknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like within the framework of the European Open
        Science Cloud (EOSC), and suggest including open science monitoring in the
        European Research Area monitoring mechanism.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Die Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer Tr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu begr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote
        und -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder gemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig zu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf internationaler
        Ebene zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Daf\xFCr sind, wie das Papier richtig
        betont, abgestimmte F\xF6rderaktivit\xE4ten erforderlich, die beispielsweise
        in Deutschland, komplement\xE4r zu DEAL, dem wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizieren
        einen deutlichen Aufschwung geben.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_html\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/kz04m-s8z58\",\"id\":\"1c578558-1324-4493-b8af-84c49eabc52f\",\"image\":\"https://wisspub.files.wordpress.com/2023/05/bildschirmc2adfoto-2023-05-23-um-11.05.39.png?w=723\",\"language\":\"de\",\"published_at\":1684833413,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"Die

        steigender Abonnementkosten und \xE4hnlicher Entwicklungen im Bereich der
        Publikationsgeb\xFChren f\xFCr Open Access und hybride Optionen betont das
        EU-Papier das Potenzial von Gesch\xE4fts- und Finanzierungsmodellen, die weder
        die Leser:innen noch die Autor:innen finanziell belasten und sich durch angemessene
        und transparente Preise auszeichnen (Punkt 6). Es wird beklagt, dass die steigenden
        Preise f\xFCr wissenschaftliche Fachinformationen zu Ungleichheiten f\xFChren
        und die \xF6ffentliche Hand in Europa zum Nachteil der Forschung belasten
        (Punkt 5).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Aufgrund dieser Kritik am kommerziellen Verlagswesen
        wird in zwei bemerkenswerten Punkten (6 und 7) die Bedeutung von nicht gewinnorientierten
        Open-Access-Modellen betont. Wortlaut:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe Council
        of the European Union [\u2026] highlights the importance of not-for-profit,
        scholarly open access publishing models that do not charge fees to authors
        or readers and where authors can publish their work without funding/institutional
        eligibility criteria; notes the variety of models that do not depend on article
        processing charges or similar per-unit charges and stresses the importance
        of supporting the development of such models led by public research organisations;
        [\u2026] stresses that it is essential to avoid situations where researchers
        are limited in their choice of publication channels due to financial capacities
        rather than quality criteria, and where access to research publications is
        restricted by paywalls\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zwar sind diese Unterstreichung
        und Betonung sicherlich nur ein kleiner Schritt auf dem Weg zur Gestaltung
        eines pluralistischen, transparenten und nachhaltigen Systems der digtialen
        Wissenschaftskommunikation. Sie kommen jedoch zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die
        Kritik an dem Modell der Publikationsgeb\xFChren w\xE4chst.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Erst
        k\xFCrzlich hat die Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation (IPLC) in den USA, als
        Zusammenschluss von Bibliotheken forschungsstarker Einrichtungen, das APC-Modell<a
        href=\\\"https://ivpluslibraries.org/2023/03/iplc-letter-to-the-office-of-science-technology-policy/\\\">
        deutlich kritisiert</a>. Die Bibliothekar:innen sehen die Gefahr, dass Publikationsgeb\xFChren
        Ungleichheit f\xF6rdern und Forschende aus finanziell weniger gut ausgestatteten
        Regionen beim Open-Access-Publizieren benachteiligt werden. Sie charakterisieren
        APCs als eine H\xFCrde bei der Publikation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch hat der
        \xF6ffentlichkeitswirksame <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5\\\">R\xFCcktritt</a>
        des Editorial Boards der Elsevier-Zeitschrift NeuroImage aufgrund steigender
        APCs den kritischen Blick auf das Gesch\xE4ftsmodell gelenkt. Die zur\xFCckgetretenen
        Herausgebenden haben nun bei MIT Press ein neues Journal <a href=\\\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/the-mit-press-to-launch-open-access-journal-imaging-neuroscience/\\\">gegr\xFCndet</a>,
        das niedrige APCs erhebt. Dieser Schritt zeigt, dass nicht APCs das Problem
        sein m\xFCssen, sondern vielmehr deren Preisgestaltung.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Um
        die im obrigen Zitat formulierten Anliegen der EU-Staaten zu adressieren,
        soll die Koordinierung innerhalb der EU und mit globalen Partnern zur Unterst\xFCtzung
        von Chancengleichheit im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren gef\xF6rdert werden
        (Absatz 7). Hierzu sollen auch abgestimmte Finanzierungsstrategien entwickelt
        werden, um die Anzahl von not-for-profit open access multi-format scholarly
        publishing models in Europe with no costs for authors or readers\u201D signifikant
        zu erh\xF6hen (Absatz 11).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Auch soll das Anliegen durch
        eine m\xF6gliche Beteiligung der EU-Mitgliedstaaten an Open Research Europe
        (ORE), der von der EU-Kommission finanzierten Publikationsplattform f\xFCr
        Autor:innen aus den EU-Rahmenprogrammen, vorangetrieben werden (Absatz 15).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        der <a href=\\\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/\\\">Pressemitteilung</a>
        werden weitere Themen der verabschiedeten Schlussfolgerungen augegriffen:\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CSome
        Member States have introduced secondary publication rights into their national
        copyright legislation, enabling open access to scholarly publications which
        involve public funds. The Council encourages national open access policies
        and guidelines to make scholarly publications immediately openly accessible
        under open licences. The conclusions acknowledge positive developments in
        terms of monitoring progress, like within the framework of the European Open
        Science Cloud (EOSC), and suggest including open science monitoring in the
        European Research Area monitoring mechanism.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Die Schlussfolgerungen
        k\xF6nnen zweifellos als St\xE4rkung des wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizierens
        in akademischer Tr\xE4gerschaft\_ interpretiert werden. Der eingeschlagene
        Kurs ist zu begr\xFC\xDFen. Um die bereits vielf\xE4ltigen Open-Access-Publikationsangebote
        und -Verlage, die von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen betrieben oder gemeinsam
        (mit angemessenen und ohne APCs) finanziert werden, nachhaltig zu st\xE4rken,
        ist es erforderlich, kooperative Finanzierungsmodelle auf internationaler
        Ebene zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Daf\xFCr sind, wie das Papier richtig
        betont, abgestimmte F\xF6rderaktivit\xE4ten erforderlich, die beispielsweise
        in Deutschland, komplement\xE4r zu DEAL, dem wissenschaftsgeleiteten Open-Access-Publizieren
        einen deutlichen Aufschwung geben.</p>\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/kz04m-s8z58\",\"reference\":[],\"summary\":\"Die

        of a talk given to the COPIM end-of-project conference: <strong><a href=\\\"https://scalingsmall.pubpub.org/\\\">\u201CScaling
        Small: Community-Owned Futures for Open Access Books\u201D</a>,</strong> April
        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. \_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. \_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an
        interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. \_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. \_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an
        interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        data citations, sharing, and reuse?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This project
        combines two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to
        merge these interests.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Q2. <strong>What questions or
        challenges were you setting out to address when you started this work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One
        of our big questions in the project as a whole is to learn more about how
        researchers cite data in their work and for which purposes, and to think about
        how this varies by academic discipline. We started out by looking at this
        question bibliometrically in <a href=\\\"https://zenodo.org/record/4730857#.ZD9Mo-xByEs\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\">work</a> led by Anton with DataCite. The survey which
        we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question from
        a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em> they
        cite data (spoiler \u2013 it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a reference
        list) and <em>what </em>they actually cite (another spoiler \u2013\_ it isn\u2019t
        always a dataset) but also to learn more about <em>why</em> they do so.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One
        of the strengths of the survey is the care that we took with constructing
        a sample which, to the best of our efforts, is representative of academic
        authors by discipline, as represented in the Web of Science. This took many
        discussions to think about how best to do this, and much planning, but it
        also allows our findings to be stronger and perhaps more generalizable to
        the broader population.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Q3. <strong>What motivates researchers
        who cite data to do so?\_</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across the entire sample,
        we found that the majority of reasons might be construed as motivations which
        reflect \u2018ideal\u2019 research practice (e.g. to show intellectual debt),
        to help others to find data, or to support the validity of their research
        claims. Few respondents indicated that external factors, namely being advised
        to do so by journals or publishers, was a motivating factor in their decision
        to cite data.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We did find some significant disciplinary
        differences to this question, though. For example, social science and humanities
        (SHH) researchers selected that they cite data to acknowledge intellectual
        debt more frequently than expected. One possible explanation for this could
        be tied to common purposes for which our SSH respondents reuse data (e.g.
        to serve as the basis for a new study or to integrate sources to build an
        argument).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><img loading=\\\"lazy\\\"

        others to cite their work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Around 84% of all respondents
        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Q5. <strong>In the survey, more than
        450 respondents said that they do not reuse data. Why do some researchers
        not reuse data?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We asked people to self-identify
        as being a person who reuses data or one who does not. This classification
        itself is perhaps a bit problematic, as we know from <a href=\\\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2705/chapter-abstract/73133/Non-Users-Also-Matter?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\">past work</a> in Science and Technology Studies that
        \u2018usage\u2019 of something\u2014be that a car or the Internet or research
        data\u2014exists on a spectrum. A researcher may reuse data to teach a class
        once per year, or they may be involved in a years-long comparative study and
        be reusing data daily, or they may not reuse data at all.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That
        said, the most frequently selected options were that reusing data was not
        relevant to their research methods or in their research communities. Other
        less frequently selected reasons\u2014such as a lack of relevant data or difficulties
        finding data\u2014indicate that perhaps some people may have tried to reuse
        data previously. I bring this up as I think it is important to remember that
        this variation in practice exists, that not everyone is a re-user of data,
        and that other ways of conducting research are also valuable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Q6.
        <strong>What are your most interesting or surprising findings?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps
        most surprising to me at a high level was how much our data had to say about
        the practices of SSH researchers. We found that SSH researchers are the only
        disciplinary groups who prefer that others cite or mention their own data,
        as opposed to other data objects (e.g. an article or a collection of data).
        This contrasts <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23529\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\">past scientometric work</a> showing that SSH scholars
        cite \u2018data studies,\u2019 rather than individual data files.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We
        were also able to identify unique differences between social scientists and

        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        data also show that most researchers who are citing data (in any way) report
        doing so for reasons in line with responsibly conducting research. This suggests
        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their
        communities and their own ethical principles. If this is the case, the questions
        I see which we need to consider are: When (and how) do we meet researchers
        where they are? When should their research practice be adapted to current
        technical requirements and our own recommendations for data citation, and
        when should those requirements and recommendations be adapted to reflect researchers\u2019
        actual practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\u2019s an important reminder that we
        need to take our time and involve research communities in the development
        of policies and systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>To stay up to date

        data citations, sharing, and reuse?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This project
        combines two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to
        merge these interests.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Q2. <strong>What questions or
        challenges were you setting out to address when you started this work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One
        of our big questions in the project as a whole is to learn more about how
        researchers cite data in their work and for which purposes, and to think about
        how this varies by academic discipline. We started out by looking at this
        question bibliometrically in <a href=\\\"https://zenodo.org/record/4730857#.ZD9Mo-xByEs\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\">work</a> led by Anton with DataCite. The survey which
        we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question from
        a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em> they
        cite data (spoiler \u2013 it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a reference
        list) and <em>what </em>they actually cite (another spoiler \u2013\_ it isn\u2019t
        always a dataset) but also to learn more about <em>why</em> they do so.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One
        of the strengths of the survey is the care that we took with constructing
        a sample which, to the best of our efforts, is representative of academic
        authors by discipline, as represented in the Web of Science. This took many
        discussions to think about how best to do this, and much planning, but it
        also allows our findings to be stronger and perhaps more generalizable to
        the broader population.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Q3. <strong>What motivates researchers
        who cite data to do so?\_</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across the entire sample,
        we found that the majority of reasons might be construed as motivations which
        reflect \u2018ideal\u2019 research practice (e.g. to show intellectual debt),
        to help others to find data, or to support the validity of their research
        claims. Few respondents indicated that external factors, namely being advised
        to do so by journals or publishers, was a motivating factor in their decision
        to cite data.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We did find some significant disciplinary
        differences to this question, though. For example, social science and humanities
        (SHH) researchers selected that they cite data to acknowledge intellectual
        debt more frequently than expected. One possible explanation for this could
        be tied to common purposes for which our SSH respondents reuse data (e.g.
        to serve as the basis for a new study or to integrate sources to build an
        argument).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><img loading=\\\"lazy\\\"

        2048w\\\" /></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Q4. <strong>How do researchers prefer
        others to cite their work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Around 84% of all respondents
        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Q5. <strong>In the survey, more than
        450 respondents said that they do not reuse data. Why do some researchers
        not reuse data?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We asked people to self-identify
        as being a person who reuses data or one who does not. This classification
        itself is perhaps a bit problematic, as we know from <a href=\\\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2705/chapter-abstract/73133/Non-Users-Also-Matter?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\">past work</a> in Science and Technology Studies that
        \u2018usage\u2019 of something\u2014be that a car or the Internet or research
        data\u2014exists on a spectrum. A researcher may reuse data to teach a class
        once per year, or they may be involved in a years-long comparative study and
        be reusing data daily, or they may not reuse data at all.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That
        said, the most frequently selected options were that reusing data was not
        relevant to their research methods or in their research communities. Other
        less frequently selected reasons\u2014such as a lack of relevant data or difficulties
        finding data\u2014indicate that perhaps some people may have tried to reuse
        data previously. I bring this up as I think it is important to remember that
        this variation in practice exists, that not everyone is a re-user of data,
        and that other ways of conducting research are also valuable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Q6.
        <strong>What are your most interesting or surprising findings?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps
        most surprising to me at a high level was how much our data had to say about
        the practices of SSH researchers. We found that SSH researchers are the only
        disciplinary groups who prefer that others cite or mention their own data,
        as opposed to other data objects (e.g. an article or a collection of data).
        This contrasts <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23529\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\">past scientometric work</a> showing that SSH scholars
        cite \u2018data studies,\u2019 rather than individual data files.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We
        were also able to identify unique differences between social scientists and
        humanities scholars, such as the tendency for humanities scholars to integrate
        data more than most other disciplinary groups or the pattern of social scientists
        to refer to related publications (rather than data) less than other groups.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><img

        on the recent memo on open science from the White House Office of Science

        would be to mandate preprints for all federally funded research. They write:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>This
        will ensure that the findings are freely accessible to anyone anywhere in
        the world. An important additional benefit is the immediate availability of
        the information, avoiding the long delays associated with evaluation by traditional
        scientific journals (typically around one year). Scientific inquiry then progresses

        on social media have noted the similarities between what the preprint servers
        are proposing here and \u2018<a href=\\\"http://planu.org/\\\">Plan U</a>\u2018,
        the 2019 initiative that attempts to \u2018sidestep the complexities and uncertainties\u2019
        of initiatives like Plan S through a similar requirement for immediate preprinting
        of all funded research. The designers of Plan U argue that preprinting is
        much simpler and cheaper because preprint servers do not perform peer review
        and so operate on a lower cost-per-paper basis. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I think
        it\u2019s important to acknowledge the disciplinary differences when it comes
        to preprinting, not just that many scholars in the arts, humanities and social
        sciences are more reluctant to preprint, but also the fact that the tradition
        of preprinting referenced here emerged out of a particularly narrow set of
        disciplinary conditions and epistemic requirements in high-energy physics.
        While by no means the only disciplinary group to share working papers (see
        economics, for example), preprinting has a rich history in high-energy physics.
        This is primarily because of the ways in which HEP research projects are structured
        between large overlapping groups from a number of institutes, each with its
        own internal review and quality-control processes that take place before a
        preprint is uploaded to the arXiv. I discussed this more in <a href=\\\"https://www.samuelmoore.org/2022/05/11/how-to-shed-light-on-in-house-publication-review-processes/\\\">a
        previous post</a> on in-house peer review processes.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason I\u2019m mentioning this is that the statement made by the repositories
        fails to account for one of the more important elements of Plan U: that such
        an approach will \u2018produce opportunities for new initiatives in peer review
        and research evaluation\u2019. The need to experiment with new models of peer
        review/research evaluation should be front and centre of any call for a new,
        open system of publishing, especially one predicated on lower costs due to
        the lack of peer review. Without well-explored alternatives, there is an implication
        that the online marketplace of ideas will just figure out the best way to
        evaluate and select research. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet the history of high-energy
        physics tells us that \u2018openness\u2019 should not be a free-for-all but
        is predicated on well-designed socio-technical infrastructures that evolved
        from and thus suit the discipline in question. But these infrastructures and
        new socialities need to be designed and implemented with care, not left for
        us to just figure it all out. This is why any system of publishing based on
        preprinting+evaluation needs adequate support to experiment and build the
        structures necessary for non-publisher-based forms of peer review. I\u2019m

        would be to mandate preprints for all federally funded research. They write:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>This
        will ensure that the findings are freely accessible to anyone anywhere in
        the world. An important additional benefit is the immediate availability of
        the information, avoiding the long delays associated with evaluation by traditional
        scientific journals (typically around one year). Scientific inquiry then progresses
        faster, as has been particularly evident for COVID research during the pandemic.</p>\\n<cite>https://connect.biorxiv.org/news/2023/04/11/ostp_response</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is familiar rhetoric and a <a href=\\\"https://fediscience.org/@petersuber/110186078720537065\\\">couple
        of</a> <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/Richvn/status/1645781547071488001\\\">commentators</a>
        on social media have noted the similarities between what the preprint servers
        are proposing here and \u2018<a href=\\\"http://planu.org/\\\">Plan U</a>\u2018,
        the 2019 initiative that attempts to \u2018sidestep the complexities and uncertainties\u2019
        of initiatives like Plan S through a similar requirement for immediate preprinting
        of all funded research. The designers of Plan U argue that preprinting is
        much simpler and cheaper because preprint servers do not perform peer review
        and so operate on a lower cost-per-paper basis. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I think
        it\u2019s important to acknowledge the disciplinary differences when it comes
        to preprinting, not just that many scholars in the arts, humanities and social
        sciences are more reluctant to preprint, but also the fact that the tradition
        of preprinting referenced here emerged out of a particularly narrow set of
        disciplinary conditions and epistemic requirements in high-energy physics.
        While by no means the only disciplinary group to share working papers (see
        economics, for example), preprinting has a rich history in high-energy physics.
        This is primarily because of the ways in which HEP research projects are structured
        between large overlapping groups from a number of institutes, each with its
        own internal review and quality-control processes that take place before a
        preprint is uploaded to the arXiv. I discussed this more in <a href=\\\"https://www.samuelmoore.org/2022/05/11/how-to-shed-light-on-in-house-publication-review-processes/\\\">a
        previous post</a> on in-house peer review processes.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason I\u2019m mentioning this is that the statement made by the repositories
        fails to account for one of the more important elements of Plan U: that such
        an approach will \u2018produce opportunities for new initiatives in peer review
        and research evaluation\u2019. The need to experiment with new models of peer
        review/research evaluation should be front and centre of any call for a new,
        open system of publishing, especially one predicated on lower costs due to
        the lack of peer review. Without well-explored alternatives, there is an implication
        that the online marketplace of ideas will just figure out the best way to
        evaluate and select research. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet the history of high-energy
        physics tells us that \u2018openness\u2019 should not be a free-for-all but
        is predicated on well-designed socio-technical infrastructures that evolved
        from and thus suit the discipline in question. But these infrastructures and
        new socialities need to be designed and implemented with care, not left for
        us to just figure it all out. This is why any system of publishing based on
        preprinting+evaluation needs adequate support to experiment and build the
        structures necessary for non-publisher-based forms of peer review. I\u2019m
        convinced, for example, that a lot of this could be built into the work of
        disciplinary societies and in-house publishing committees. Yet these ideas
        require financial support to see what works. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the context
        of the never-ending crisis in peer review, the OSTP memo could serve as a

        <a href=\\\"https://makedatacount.org/team/\\\">Advisory Board of</a>. Which
        is a stable framework, but requires a broader adoption to make it useful.
        Currently, we are in a slight chicken-and-egg situation with repositories
        reluctant to offer the data metrics until someone provides the specifications
        of what exactly should be provided. The funders are not pushing for anything
        specific about data usage partly because they don\u2019t know what is possible.
        Authors still focussed on journal citation as a mechanism of reward, meaning
        they aren\u2019t particularly motivated to push for data usage measuring.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One effort to jump-start the process is the Wellcome initiative
        to create a global corpus of data citations and data mentions. The initiative
        is gathering a corpus of references to published data within <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.5438/vjz9-kx84\\\">journal
        articles and pre-prints</a>. It aims to provide a global set of measurable

        Usage Tracker</a> (beta release). The goal of the tracker is to reduce the
        burden of implementing usage tracking on repositories. The general idea is
        that a repository embeds a small javascript in the landing page of the dataset.
        This sends a message to the DataCite usage tracker every time someone visits
        the page. In addition, another javascript can be embedded in a download confirmation
        page which then counts the number of downloads of that dataset. \_This is
        a beta service at the moment, and one that GigaDB intends to implement, so

        software as research objects. Including presentations from FAIR4RS and DOME-ML,
        as well as CodeMeta. The latter is an attempt to standardise the way in which
        developers can share the metadata about their software and code. Essentially
        it is a JSON-LD schema that includes holders for all the important bits of
        information that a potential user (either human or computer) may require to
        use the software, e.g. the citation details, version number, dependencies,
        environment, the status of code, community links, etc\u2026</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It
        wasn\u2019t all just presentation after presentation. Many of the sessions

        started (Monday 20th) as well as the day after (Friday 24th), there were several
        co-located meetings being held, so effectively it was a 5 day meeting. For
        many of the attendees it was their first F2F meeting in 3 years due to the
        pandemic, so those people found it particularly hard work staying actively
        engaged.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We reconnected with our colleagues at DataCite

        keynotes in the morning followed by parallel breakout sessions from mid-morning
        through to the end of the day. The organisers had helpfully provided a set
        of suggested <a href=\\\"https://www.rd-alliance.org/rdas-20th-plenary-pathways\\\">pathways</a>
        for attendees to use based on the theme(s) of interest; one suggestion I have
        to further improve this would be to include the days/times and rooms of the
        suggested sessions to aid navigation at the event</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Here I

        Usage Working Group output</a> which recommends 5 things :\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1:
        Data usage is complicated, while these complex areas will need to be resolved,
        the focus should remain on the adoption of minimal frameworks for counting
        data usage.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2: Utilizing the <a href=\\\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.projectcounter.org/code-practice-research-data/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1680112038612683&amp;usg=AOvVaw0uoTE9HfDb0ueMAFN0mqDw\\\">COUNTER
        Code of Practice for Research Data</a>, and utilizing DataCite for aggregations.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3:
        There should be caution against defaulting to data metrics like a data impact
        factor.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4: Consider potential shortcomings, mitigations
        that can be made, and broader use cases for implementation to better understand
        usage types.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5: Close coordination with <a href=\\\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.scholix.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1680112038613139&amp;usg=AOvVaw2sXCoPnoJ3oDdLYKuhhgno\\\">Scholix</a>
        is recommended as usage and citation are closely tied together.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a
        href=\\\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7234-3684&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1680112038613800&amp;usg=AOvVaw261ZLXsioHVggyZ26lx68J\\\">Matt
        Buys</a> from DataCite followed with an update on the <a href=\\\"https://makedatacount.org/\\\">Make
        Data Count Initiative</a>, of which our team member Scott Edmunds is on the
        <a href=\\\"https://makedatacount.org/team/\\\">Advisory Board of</a>. Which
        is a stable framework, but requires a broader adoption to make it useful.
        Currently, we are in a slight chicken-and-egg situation with repositories
        reluctant to offer the data metrics until someone provides the specifications
        of what exactly should be provided. The funders are not pushing for anything
        specific about data usage partly because they don\u2019t know what is possible.
        Authors still focussed on journal citation as a mechanism of reward, meaning
        they aren\u2019t particularly motivated to push for data usage measuring.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One effort to jump-start the process is the Wellcome initiative
        to create a global corpus of data citations and data mentions. The initiative
        is gathering a corpus of references to published data within <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.5438/vjz9-kx84\\\">journal
        articles and pre-prints</a>. It aims to provide a global set of measurable
        links that can be used to explore what is possible and what is useful in terms
        of data usage tracking.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6133-4045&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1680112038614614&amp;usg=AOvVaw0A3cWgfOweZUt3W4Uf4jYZ\\\">Kelly

        Usage Tracker</a> (beta release). The goal of the tracker is to reduce the
        burden of implementing usage tracking on repositories. The general idea is
        that a repository embeds a small javascript in the landing page of the dataset.
        This sends a message to the DataCite usage tracker every time someone visits
        the page. In addition, another javascript can be embedded in a download confirmation
        page which then counts the number of downloads of that dataset. \_This is
        a beta service at the moment, and one that GigaDB intends to implement, so
        watch this space!</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There were a number of sessions discussing
        software as research objects. Including presentations from FAIR4RS and DOME-ML,
        as well as CodeMeta. The latter is an attempt to standardise the way in which
        developers can share the metadata about their software and code. Essentially
        it is a JSON-LD schema that includes holders for all the important bits of
        information that a potential user (either human or computer) may require to
        use the software, e.g. the citation details, version number, dependencies,
        environment, the status of code, community links, etc\u2026</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It
        wasn\u2019t all just presentation after presentation. Many of the sessions
        included panel discussions to engage with the audiences. The co-located workshops
        book-ending the meeting all included collaborative working sessions to move
        the groups forward towards their respective goals.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><img

        without networking events. RDA20 provided two such opportunities. First was
        the birthday celebration in the fabulous town hall (see Fig2). As well as
        the conference dinner which included live entertainment from the Chalmers
        University band-cum-circus act!? Think big brass band meets circus clowns,
        you had to see it to believe it.<br />All-in-all the meeting was a great success,
        a tribute to all those involved organising and participating in it. The next
