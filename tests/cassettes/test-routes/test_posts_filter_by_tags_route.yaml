        20th 2023</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When Janneke and I were
        writing our <a href=\\\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\\\">\u2018scaling
        small\u2019</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining \u2018scaling small\u2019, we looked to the commons
        as a way of thinking through these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a mode of
        production based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons
        was a natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted
        the informal mutual reliance \u2013 what we referred to as the latent commons,
        borrowing from Anna Tsing (2017) \u2013 within the Radical Open Access Collective
        right through to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so,
        we illustrated the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative
        publishing projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant
        mode of production. Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be
        sustained if we embed ourselves in each other\u2019s projects and infrastructures
        in a way that has \u2018global reach but preserves local contexts\u2019 (Adema
        and Moore 2021). It is a reminder that the commons is an active social process
        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        an interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness \u2013 or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what\u2019s needed to allow research to reach its full potential.
        The drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\\\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\\\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\\\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes

        rather than a fixed set of open resources available to all. \_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        their posthumously released book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>,
        Lauren Berlant writes against a fixed understanding of the commons that \u2018merely
        needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up with it\u2019 (Berlant
        2022). Instead, for Berlant, the \u2018better power\u2019 of the commons is
        to \u2018point to a way to view what\u2019s broken in sociality, the difficulty
        of convening a world conjointly\u2019. From our perspective, the commons is
        about revealing how hard it is to scale small in a world dominated by the
        need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not, then, about having a fixed
        understanding of the infrastructures necessary for open access publishing
        but more about experimenting with the different kinds of socialities that
        may allow experimental infrastructures of different scales and formalities
        to flourish.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is why scaling small reveals the limits
        of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures (echoing the
        \u2018good cuts\u2019 of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska\u2019s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, relying on the fact
        that we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book
        publishing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet of course, antagonism still exists within
        and outside the COPIM project. Is it OK that the models and infrastructures
        being developed within this community are being extracted from it by commercial
        publishers? Bloomsbury, for example, has just proudly announced it is the
        first commercial book publisher to utilise the kind of collective funding
        model being developed by COPIM, Open Library of Humanities, and other scholar-led
        publishers. How is it possible to scale small when a big commercial actor
        is waiting to take what you have developed and piggyback on it for commercial
        gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers or keep them at arms\u2019 length?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again,
        part of the answer to this question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM
        has managed to carve out a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education
        that has brought together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations
        with an explicit goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers
        in place of community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open
        access journals that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe,
        we have an important counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities
        cross-pollinating with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers
        may treat COPIM\u2019s work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social
        glue that keeps it together and sets it apart from marketised models.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This
        is why I am so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\\\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\\\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook \u2013 as is too often the case with new open access initiatives
        \u2013 and given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective.
        Scaling small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire. \_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an
        interdisciplinary, multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing
        futures, I hope we can also consider how scaling small may help transform
        our professional networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of
        learned societies and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care
        within and between them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains
        of equivalence between previously disparate learned societies and member organisations,
        allowing us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures
        of marketised academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adema,

        data citations, sharing, and reuse?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This project
        combines two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to
        merge these interests.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Q2. <strong>What questions or
        challenges were you setting out to address when you started this work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One
        of our big questions in the project as a whole is to learn more about how
        researchers cite data in their work and for which purposes, and to think about
        how this varies by academic discipline. We started out by looking at this
        question bibliometrically in <a href=\\\"https://zenodo.org/record/4730857#.ZD9Mo-xByEs\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\">work</a> led by Anton with DataCite. The survey which
        we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question from
        a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em> they
        cite data (spoiler \u2013 it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a reference
        list) and <em>what </em>they actually cite (another spoiler \u2013\_ it isn\u2019t
        always a dataset) but also to learn more about <em>why</em> they do so.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One
        of the strengths of the survey is the care that we took with constructing
        a sample which, to the best of our efforts, is representative of academic
        authors by discipline, as represented in the Web of Science. This took many
        discussions to think about how best to do this, and much planning, but it
        also allows our findings to be stronger and perhaps more generalizable to
        the broader population.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Q3. <strong>What motivates researchers
        who cite data to do so?\_</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across the entire sample,
        we found that the majority of reasons might be construed as motivations which
        reflect \u2018ideal\u2019 research practice (e.g. to show intellectual debt),
        to help others to find data, or to support the validity of their research
        claims. Few respondents indicated that external factors, namely being advised
        to do so by journals or publishers, was a motivating factor in their decision
        to cite data.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We did find some significant disciplinary
        differences to this question, though. For example, social science and humanities
        (SHH) researchers selected that they cite data to acknowledge intellectual
        debt more frequently than expected. One possible explanation for this could
        be tied to common purposes for which our SSH respondents reuse data (e.g.
        to serve as the basis for a new study or to integrate sources to build an
        argument).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><img loading=\\\"lazy\\\"

        2048w\\\" /></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Q4. <strong>How do researchers prefer
        others to cite their work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Around 84% of all respondents
        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Q5. <strong>In the survey, more than
        450 respondents said that they do not reuse data. Why do some researchers
        not reuse data?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We asked people to self-identify
        as being a person who reuses data or one who does not. This classification
        itself is perhaps a bit problematic, as we know from <a href=\\\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2705/chapter-abstract/73133/Non-Users-Also-Matter?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\">past work</a> in Science and Technology Studies that
        \u2018usage\u2019 of something\u2014be that a car or the Internet or research
        data\u2014exists on a spectrum. A researcher may reuse data to teach a class
        once per year, or they may be involved in a years-long comparative study and
        be reusing data daily, or they may not reuse data at all.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That
        said, the most frequently selected options were that reusing data was not
        relevant to their research methods or in their research communities. Other
        less frequently selected reasons\u2014such as a lack of relevant data or difficulties
        finding data\u2014indicate that perhaps some people may have tried to reuse
        data previously. I bring this up as I think it is important to remember that
        this variation in practice exists, that not everyone is a re-user of data,
        and that other ways of conducting research are also valuable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Q6.
        <strong>What are your most interesting or surprising findings?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps
        most surprising to me at a high level was how much our data had to say about
        the practices of SSH researchers. We found that SSH researchers are the only
        disciplinary groups who prefer that others cite or mention their own data,
        as opposed to other data objects (e.g. an article or a collection of data).
        This contrasts <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23529\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\">past scientometric work</a> showing that SSH scholars
        cite \u2018data studies,\u2019 rather than individual data files.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We
        were also able to identify unique differences between social scientists and
        humanities scholars, such as the tendency for humanities scholars to integrate
        data more than most other disciplinary groups or the pattern of social scientists
        to refer to related publications (rather than data) less than other groups.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><img

        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        data also show that most researchers who are citing data (in any way) report
        doing so for reasons in line with responsibly conducting research. This suggests
        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their
        communities and their own ethical principles. If this is the case, the questions
        I see which we need to consider are: When (and how) do we meet researchers
        where they are? When should their research practice be adapted to current
        technical requirements and our own recommendations for data citation, and
        when should those requirements and recommendations be adapted to reflect researchers\u2019
        actual practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\u2019s an important reminder that we
        need to take our time and involve research communities in the development
        of policies and systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>To stay up to date

        data citations, sharing, and reuse?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This project
        combines two of my long standing interests: research data practices and bibliometrics.
        I\u2019ve been interested in data sharing since my early days as an academic
        librarian when open access to data from federally funded research was first
        being discussed. This interest eventually led me to do a PhD exploring how
        researchers discover, make sense of and reuse data. Before doing my PhD, I
        spent some time focusing on bibliometric services in libraries and thinking
        about the responsible use of metrics in academic assessments. Exploring data
        citation practices, and their repercussions, provided a nice opportunity to
        merge these interests.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Q2. <strong>What questions or
        challenges were you setting out to address when you started this work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One
        of our big questions in the project as a whole is to learn more about how
        researchers cite data in their work and for which purposes, and to think about
        how this varies by academic discipline. We started out by looking at this
        question bibliometrically in <a href=\\\"https://zenodo.org/record/4730857#.ZD9Mo-xByEs\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\">work</a> led by Anton with DataCite. The survey which
        we report on in the preprint gave us a chance to look at this question from
        a different angle and to ask researchers not only about <em>how</em> they
        cite data (spoiler \u2013 it isn\u2019t always with a citation in a reference
        list) and <em>what </em>they actually cite (another spoiler \u2013\_ it isn\u2019t
        always a dataset) but also to learn more about <em>why</em> they do so.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One
        of the strengths of the survey is the care that we took with constructing
        a sample which, to the best of our efforts, is representative of academic
        authors by discipline, as represented in the Web of Science. This took many
        discussions to think about how best to do this, and much planning, but it
        also allows our findings to be stronger and perhaps more generalizable to
        the broader population.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Q3. <strong>What motivates researchers
        who cite data to do so?\_</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across the entire sample,
        we found that the majority of reasons might be construed as motivations which
        reflect \u2018ideal\u2019 research practice (e.g. to show intellectual debt),
        to help others to find data, or to support the validity of their research
        claims. Few respondents indicated that external factors, namely being advised
        to do so by journals or publishers, was a motivating factor in their decision
        to cite data.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We did find some significant disciplinary
        differences to this question, though. For example, social science and humanities
        (SHH) researchers selected that they cite data to acknowledge intellectual
        debt more frequently than expected. One possible explanation for this could
        be tied to common purposes for which our SSH respondents reuse data (e.g.
        to serve as the basis for a new study or to integrate sources to build an
        argument).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><img loading=\\\"lazy\\\"

        others to cite their work?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Around 84% of all respondents
        indicated that they would like others to refer to a related article or publication,
        followed by the data source (55%), and then the data themselves (46%). I found
        it super interesting, though, that nearly three-quarters of all respondents
        selected more than one option for this question. For example, about 950 respondents
        selected wanting other people to cite or mention both a related research article
        <em>as well as</em> the data themselves. This complicates the existing narratives
        suggesting that data citations alone may incentivise sharing data and suggests
        that a combination of citing different \u2018data objects\u2019 may be preferred
        by researchers.\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Q5. <strong>In the survey, more than
        450 respondents said that they do not reuse data. Why do some researchers
        not reuse data?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We asked people to self-identify
        as being a person who reuses data or one who does not. This classification
        itself is perhaps a bit problematic, as we know from <a href=\\\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2705/chapter-abstract/73133/Non-Users-Also-Matter?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\">past work</a> in Science and Technology Studies that
        \u2018usage\u2019 of something\u2014be that a car or the Internet or research
        data\u2014exists on a spectrum. A researcher may reuse data to teach a class
        once per year, or they may be involved in a years-long comparative study and
        be reusing data daily, or they may not reuse data at all.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That
        said, the most frequently selected options were that reusing data was not
        relevant to their research methods or in their research communities. Other
        less frequently selected reasons\u2014such as a lack of relevant data or difficulties
        finding data\u2014indicate that perhaps some people may have tried to reuse
        data previously. I bring this up as I think it is important to remember that
        this variation in practice exists, that not everyone is a re-user of data,
        and that other ways of conducting research are also valuable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Q6.
        <strong>What are your most interesting or surprising findings?</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps
        most surprising to me at a high level was how much our data had to say about
        the practices of SSH researchers. We found that SSH researchers are the only
        disciplinary groups who prefer that others cite or mention their own data,
        as opposed to other data objects (e.g. an article or a collection of data).
        This contrasts <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23529\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\">past scientometric work</a> showing that SSH scholars
        cite \u2018data studies,\u2019 rather than individual data files.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We
        were also able to identify unique differences between social scientists and
        humanities scholars, such as the tendency for humanities scholars to integrate
        data more than most other disciplinary groups or the pattern of social scientists
        to refer to related publications (rather than data) less than other groups.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><img

        study brings up what I think is a key question when designing policies and
        standards in the research data space in general. Our data show that data citation
        is rooted in longstanding disciplinary practices (e.g. the use of footnotes
        in the humanities), choices about standards (e.g. the use of APA citation
        guidelines in the social sciences) and choosing <em>what</em> to cite (e.g.
        the common practice of citing publications in addition to or instead of data).\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our
        data also show that most researchers who are citing data (in any way) report
        doing so for reasons in line with responsibly conducting research. This suggests
        that their current citation practices may be meeting both the norms of their
        communities and their own ethical principles. If this is the case, the questions
        I see which we need to consider are: When (and how) do we meet researchers
        where they are? When should their research practice be adapted to current
        technical requirements and our own recommendations for data citation, and
        when should those requirements and recommendations be adapted to reflect researchers\u2019
        actual practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It\u2019s an important reminder that we
        need to take our time and involve research communities in the development
        of policies and systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>To stay up to date

        differences when it comes to preprinting, not just that many scholars in the
        arts, humanities and social sciences are more reluctant to preprint, but also
        the fact that the tradition of preprinting referenced here emerged out of
        a particularly narrow set of disciplinary conditions and epistemic requirements
        in high-energy physics. While by no means the only disciplinary group to share
        working papers (see economics, for example), preprinting has a rich history
        in high-energy physics. This is primarily because of the ways in which HEP
        research projects are structured between large overlapping groups from a number
        of institutes, each with its own internal review and quality-control processes
        that take place before a preprint is uploaded to the arXiv. I discussed this
        more in <a href=\\\"https://www.samuelmoore.org/2022/05/11/how-to-shed-light-on-in-house-publication-review-processes/\\\">a
        previous post</a> on in-house peer review processes.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason I&#8217;m mentioning this is that the statement made by the repositories
        fails to account for one of the more important elements of Plan U: that such
        an approach will &#8216;produce opportunities for new initiatives in peer
        review and research evaluation&#8217;. The need to experiment with new models
        of peer review/research evaluation should be front and centre of any call
        for a new, open system of publishing, especially one predicated on lower costs
        due to the lack of peer review. Without well-explored alternatives, there
        is an implication that the online marketplace of ideas will just figure out
        the best way to evaluate and select research. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet the history
        of high-energy physics tells us that &#8216;openness&#8217; should not be
        a free-for-all but is predicated on well-designed socio-technical infrastructures
        that evolved from and thus suit the discipline in question. But these infrastructures
        and new socialities need to be designed and implemented with care, not left
        for us to just figure it all out. This is why any system of publishing based
        on preprinting+evaluation needs adequate support to experiment and build the
        structures necessary for non-publisher-based forms of peer review. I&#8217;m
        convinced, for example, that a lot of this could be built into the work of
        disciplinary societies and in-house publishing committees. Yet these ideas
        require financial support to see what works. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the context
        of the never-ending crisis in peer review, the OSTP memo could serve as a
        springboard for figuring out and operationalising new forms of research evaluation.
        This could make for a sensitive transition away from traditional publication
        practices that help the commercial publishing industry maintain control of
        scholarly communication. The memo is therefore a good opportunity to experiment
        and build entirely new approaches to academic publishing &#8212; but we have
        to make the correct arguments for how we figure this out, not arguments based
        on cheaper publishing and web-based editorial free-for-alls.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/wqkcw-5kt62\",\"id\":\"22939\",\"image\":\"https://www.samuelmoore.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/High-Energy-Physics-Header-Image.jpg\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1681327534,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"Yesterday,

        it\u2019s important to acknowledge the disciplinary differences when it comes
        to preprinting, not just that many scholars in the arts, humanities and social
        sciences are more reluctant to preprint, but also the fact that the tradition
        of preprinting referenced here emerged out of a particularly narrow set of
        disciplinary conditions and epistemic requirements in high-energy physics.
        While by no means the only disciplinary group to share working papers (see
        economics, for example), preprinting has a rich history in high-energy physics.
        This is primarily because of the ways in which HEP research projects are structured
        between large overlapping groups from a number of institutes, each with its

        article presents a commentary on the recent resurgence of interest in the
        practice of rights retention in scholarly publishing. Led in part by the evolving
        European policy landscape, rights retention seeks to ensure immediate access
        to accepted manuscripts uploaded to repositories. The article identifies a
        trajectory in the development of rights retention from something that publishers
        could previously ignore to a practice they are now forced to confront. Despite
        being couched in the neoliberal logic of market-centric policymaking, I argue
        that rights retention represents a more combative approach to publisher power
        by institutions and funders that could yield significant benefits for a more
        equitable system of open access publishing.</p>\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/dxmjy-ssz95\",\"reference\":[],\"summary\":\"I\u2019ve
