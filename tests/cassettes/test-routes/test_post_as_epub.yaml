      includes science newsletters.\\n\\n## Failure of advertising as a revenue model\\n\\nThe
      most important driver of this trend is probably the realization that\\nadvertising
      is a poor revenue model for content published on the web,\\nincluding blogs.
      Even more so for science content, which seldom draws a\\nlot of traffic but
      rather typically caters to small, fragmented\\ncommunities. This trend is only
      aggravated by the development of\\ntargeted advertising platforms and technologies,
      which don\\\\'t respect\\nthe users\\\\' privacy and in turn led to legislation
      such as GDPR\\n([General Data Protection\\nRegulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}),\\nimplemented
      in the European Union in May 2018.\\n\\n## Failure of Twitter and social media\\n\\nA
      direct consequence of this *rat race* around advertising revenue and\\nuser
      privacy, made worse by a pandemic that dramatically changed how we\\ninteract
      online, is that social media are seeing the biggest changes in\\nmore than 10
      years. Twitter changed ownership 12 months ago and is no\\nlonger *the* place
      to communicate science, including finding out about\\nnew publications, science
      events, or science blog posts. One side effect\\nof this development is that\\n[altmetrics](https://altmetrics.org/manifesto/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
      have\\nstopped being useful. Scientists have dramatically [reduced their use
      of\\nTwitter](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-02554-0){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nor
      have moved to other social media platforms. And the visibility of\\nposts on
      the platform formerly known as Twitter is now determined mainly\\nby [algorithmic\\nfeeds](https://indieweb.org/algorithmic_feed){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
      rather\\nthan their users. Facebook/Meta and Reddit have similar issues, and
      this\\nis related to private organizations owning and controlling most popular\\nsocial
      media platforms.\\n\\n## Newsletters as an alternative\\n\\nNewsletters provide
      an [interesting\\nalternative](https://ghost.org/resources/how-to-make-money-blogging/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nto
      advertising and \\\\\\\"traditional\\\\\\\" social media. They are particularly\\npromising
      for science blogs, as they can be easily combined with\\nblogging platforms.
      Either as a single platform as with Ghost (used by\\nthis blog), Substack, or
      Medium, or integrated with the blogging\\nplatform, as several science blogs
      participating in Rogue Scholar are\\ndoing.\\n\\nNewsletters can provide a revenue
      source that is more sustainable than\\nadvertising, and they reach users directly
      rather than depending on\\nsocial media which currently are undergoing major
      changes.\\n\\n## The problems with newsletters\\n\\nNewsletters are not without
      problems. The biggest challenge I see is\\nthat they make it very easy to lock
      content behind a paywall. Which does\\nnot align well with the overall trend
      toward Open Access and scholarly\\ncontent that is free to read and reuse.\\n\\nAnother
      challenge is that email is not always the best medium for\\nscholarly communication.
      Email is fine for occasional newsletters, but\\ndoesn\\\\'t really scale well.
      There are good reasons we have RSS readers\\nand social media, and depending
      on newsletters only feels like a\\nregression to how we communicated in the
      early 1990s.\\n\\n## Conclusions\\n\\nNewsletters are an evolving format that
      can nicely integrate with\\nscience blogs. For science blogs, it is important
      that the content\\nremains free to read and reuse (ideally using a CC-BC license),
      and that\\nthe content remains also available via RSS feed and web page. This\\napproach
      aligns with the [Principles of Open Scholarly\\nInfrastructure](https://doi.org/10.24343/C34W2H){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}:\\n\\n>
      **Revenue based on services, not data**\_-- data related to the running\\n>
      of the research enterprise should be a community property. Appropriate\\n> revenue
      sources might include value-added services, consulting, API\\n> Service Level
      Agreements or membership fees.\\n\\nFront Matter is offering two newsletters:\\n\\n-
      The **Front Matter newsletter** distributes the blog posts of this\\n  blog,
      which currently focus on the Rogue Scholar science blog service\\n  and related
      topics. Recommended for all bloggers participating in the\\n  Rogue Scholar
      service. You can subscribe\\n  [here](https://blog.front-matter.io/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\n-
      The **Syldavia Gazette newsletter** publishes summaries of interesting\\n  science
      blog posts found on the web, including an automated weekly\\n  digest of new
      blog posts archived in the Rogue Scholar science blog\\n  archive over the past
      seven days. You can subscribe\\n  [here](https://syldavia-gazette.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\n\\nOver
      the last two days I have reorganized the Front Matter newsletters\\ninto one
      technical newsletter (Front Matter) and one journalistic\\nnewsletter (Syldavia
      Gazette). In the process, I had to move the\\nexisting subscriptions around.
      Please unsubscribe if you now receive a\\nFront Matter newsletter you no longer
      wish to receive.\\n\\nThe new format of the Syldavia Gazette newsletter (including
      the weekly\\nRogue Scholar digest) poses an interesting problem best described
      in the\\nmovie *Ghostbusters*:\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"kg-card kg-image-card\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://media.tenor.com/2YAgdU9Ifo8AAAAC/dont-cross-the-streams-ghostbusters.gif\\\"\\nclass=\\\"kg-image\\\"
      loading=\\\"lazy\\\" width=\\\"498\\\" height=\\\"206\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\nRogue
      Scholar automatically archives all blog posts of participating\\nscience blogs.
      If the Syldavia Gazette publishes digests of Rogue\\nScholar blog posts, this
      could lead to an interesting loop. The solution\\nwas to implement a new feature
      in Rogue Scholar to only archive some\\nblog posts using a filter. This of course
      is also useful for other use\\ncases discussed several times where only some
      posts should be included\\nin Rogue Scholar, archived, and assigned a DOI.\\n\\n##

      rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\">Ghost</a>, <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\">Medium</a>,
      and <a href=\\\"https://substack.com/\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\">Substack</a>.
      \ Which of course also includes science newsletters.</p><h2 id=\\\"failure-of-advertising-as-a-revenue-model\\\">Failure
      of advertising as a revenue model</h2><p>The most important driver of this trend
      is probably the realization that advertising is a poor revenue model for content
      published on the web, including blogs. Even more so for science content, which
      seldom draws a lot of traffic but rather typically caters to small, fragmented
      communities. This trend is only aggravated by the development of targeted advertising
      platforms and technologies, which don't respect the users' privacy and in turn
      led to legislation such as GDPR (<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation\\\"
      rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\">General Data Protection Regulation</a>), implemented
      in the European Union in May 2018. </p><h2 id=\\\"failure-of-twitter-and-social-media\\\">Failure
      of Twitter and social media</h2><p>A direct consequence of this <em>rat race
      </em>around advertising revenue and user privacy, made worse by a pandemic that
      dramatically changed how we interact online, is that social media are seeing
      the biggest changes in more than 10 years. Twitter changed ownership 12 months
      ago and is no longer <em>the</em> place to communicate science, including finding
      out about new publications, science events, or science blog posts. One side
      effect of this development is that <a href=\\\"https://altmetrics.org/manifesto/\\\"
      rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\">altmetrics</a> have stopped being useful. Scientists
      have dramatically <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-02554-0\\\"
      rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\">reduced their use of Twitter</a> or have moved to other
      social media platforms. And the visibility of posts on the platform formerly
      known as Twitter is now determined mainly by <a href=\\\"https://indieweb.org/algorithmic_feed\\\"
      rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\">algorithmic feeds</a> rather than their users. Facebook/Meta
      and Reddit have similar issues, and this is related to private organizations
      owning and controlling most popular social media platforms.</p><h2 id=\\\"newsletters-as-an-alternative\\\">Newsletters
      as an alternative</h2><p>Newsletters provide an <a href=\\\"https://ghost.org/resources/how-to-make-money-blogging/\\\"
      rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\">interesting alternative</a> to advertising and \\\"traditional\\\"
      social media. They are particularly promising for science blogs, as they can
      be easily combined with blogging platforms. Either as a single platform as with
      Ghost (used by this blog), Substack, or Medium, or integrated with the blogging
      platform, as several science blogs participating in Rogue Scholar are doing.</p><p>Newsletters
      can provide a revenue source that is more sustainable than advertising, and
      they reach users directly rather than depending on social media which currently
      are undergoing major changes.</p><h2 id=\\\"the-problems-with-newsletters\\\">The
      problems with newsletters</h2><p>Newsletters are not without problems. The biggest
      challenge I see is that they make it very easy to lock content behind a paywall.
      Which does not align well with the overall trend toward Open Access and scholarly
      content that is free to read and reuse.</p><p>Another challenge is that email
      is not always the best medium for scholarly communication. Email is fine for
      occasional newsletters, but doesn't really scale well. There are good reasons
      we have RSS readers and social media, and depending on newsletters only feels
      like a regression to how we communicated in the early 1990s.</p><h2 id=\\\"conclusions\\\">Conclusions</h2><p>Newsletters
      are an evolving format that can nicely integrate with science blogs. For science
      blogs, it is important that the content remains free to read and reuse (ideally
      using a CC-BC license), and that the content remains also available via RSS
      feed and web page. This approach aligns with the <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.24343/C34W2H\\\"
      rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\">Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure</a>:</p><blockquote><strong>Revenue
      based on services, not data</strong>&nbsp;\u2013 data related to the running
      of the research enterprise should be a community property. Appropriate revenue
      sources might include value-added services, consulting, API Service Level Agreements
      or membership fees.</blockquote><p>Front Matter is offering two newsletters:</p><ul><li>The
      <strong>Front Matter newsletter</strong> distributes the blog posts of this
      blog, which currently focus on the Rogue Scholar science blog service and related
      topics. Recommended for all bloggers participating in the Rogue Scholar service.
      You can subscribe <a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\">here</a>.</li><li>The
      <strong>Syldavia Gazette newsletter</strong> publishes summaries of interesting
      science blog posts found on the web, including an automated weekly digest of
      new blog posts archived in the Rogue Scholar science blog archive over the past
      seven days. You can subscribe <a href=\\\"https://syldavia-gazette.org/\\\"
      rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\">here</a>.</li></ul><p>Over the last two days I have reorganized
      the Front Matter newsletters into one technical newsletter (Front Matter) and
      one journalistic newsletter (Syldavia Gazette). In the process, I had to move
      the existing subscriptions around. Please unsubscribe if you now receive a Front
      Matter newsletter you no longer wish to receive.</p><p>The new format of the
      Syldavia Gazette newsletter (including the weekly Rogue Scholar digest) poses
      an interesting problem best described in the movie <em>Ghostbusters</em>:</p><figure
      class=\\\"kg-card kg-image-card\\\"><img src=\\\"https://media.tenor.com/2YAgdU9Ifo8AAAAC/dont-cross-the-streams-ghostbusters.gif\\\"
      class=\\\"kg-image\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\" width=\\\"498\\\" height=\\\"206\\\"></figure><p>Rogue
      Scholar automatically archives all blog posts of participating science blogs.
      If the Syldavia Gazette publishes digests of Rogue Scholar blog posts, this
      could lead to an interesting loop. The solution was to implement a new feature
      in Rogue Scholar to only archive some blog posts using a filter. This of course
      is also useful for other use cases discussed several times where only some posts
      should be included in Rogue Scholar, archived, and assigned a DOI.</p><h2 id=\\\"references\\\">References</h2><ol><li>Vidal
