      effective are research assessment reform initiatives in mobilizing\\ncollective
      action? Framework and case studies of DORA and CoARA\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n***Alex
      Rushforth**\_and Gunnar Sivertsen*\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nRecent years have
      seen considerable growth of reform movements aiming to\\narrest perceived dysfunctions
      across science. A prominent problem that\\nhas formed the focus of activism
      in academia has been research\\nassessment practices. Multi-actor initiatives
      such as the Declaration on\\nResearch Assessment (DORA) and the Coalition on
      Advancing Research\\nAssessment (CoARA) have served as prominent backbone organizations
      for\\nthis movement, coordinating collective action among diverse research\\nstakeholders.
      As governance structures within science, a notable\\ncharacteristic is their
      reliance upon 'soft governance' and 'self\\nregulation', rather than incentives
      or coercion. In this paper we take\\nstock of how effective these example initiatives
      have been in\\ncoordinating and mobilizing collective action on their respective\\nproblems.
      We introduce a framework to compare the initiatives, apply it\\nto these two
      cases, and draw conclusions about the respective\\nachievements, challenges,
      and limitations of these structures.\\n\\nThe inventive spill-over of corporate
      publications\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n*Antoine Schoen, Patricia Laurens, Gaston
      Heimeriks, Martina\\nNeul\xE4ndtner, Thomas Scherngell, **Alfredo Yegros**,
      and Philippe Lar\xE9do*\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nThis paper looks at how scientific
      collaboration linking universities\\nand large international firms fosters local
      invention. The first step\\naims at identifying the universities engaged in
      collaboration with large\\ncorporate entities belonging to the industrial sectors
      of\\npharmaceuticals, chemicals and biotechnology. After having identified\\nthe
      corpus of corporate publications authored by these enterprises we\\nanalyse
      in this corpus the universities engaged in this corporate\\nscientific collaboration
      allocating the co-authoring institutions in the\\nterritories hosting the academic
      authors. The extent and nature of the\\nuniversities' collaboration with large
      firms is then analysed using the\\nSAR model in regard to the intensity of local
      inventive intensity in the\\nmetropolitan area hosting the universities. The
      results show that\\ncorporate publications have a clear and significant effect
      on inventive\\noutcome and production.\\n\\nIncentivizing, excluding, and enduring:

      Authors\\n\\n***Eleonora Dagiene**, Vincent Larivi\xE8re, and **Ludo Waltman***\\n\\n####
      Abstract\\n\\nLithuania's research assessment prioritises Web of Science publications,\\naiming
      for international impact. This paper examines the policy,\\nintroduced in 2012,
      of excluding articles from journals with low impact\\nfactor or suspected citation
      inflation. We analyse how this suspension\\npolicy affected domestic journals
      and researchers' behaviour. The\\nresults show that Lithuanian researchers'
      publications in foreign\\noutlets increased, but concerns remain about the chosen
      outlets' quality\\nand potential continuing manipulation of Web of Science metrics.
      These\\nare initial findings of a broader study exploring policy dynamics and\\nunexpected
      consequences of quantitative research assessment.\\n\\nDoes mobility help to
      build bridge of collaboration between origin and\\ndestination country\\n\\n####
      Authors\\n\\n***Huilin Ge**, **Clara Calero Medina**, and **Rodrigo Costas***\\n\\n####
      Abstract\\n\\nAcademic mobility is a phenomenon in today's academic landscape
      that\\nfacilitates global collaboration and knowledge transfer. Despite the\\nbenefits
      of academic mobility, concerns about brain drain persist, and\\nfears of inequalities
      in mobility dynamics start to emerge. Our research\\nexplores the relationship
      between mobile researchers and the\\ncollaboration ties with their country of
      origin, revealing a remarkable\\ntrend: mobile academics maintain varying degrees
      of collaboration with\\ntheir origin countries after moving. Scholars migrating
      from\\nhigher-income countries to lower-income ones exhibit a strong\\ninclination
      to maintain ties with their highincome origins, but the\\nreverse is not observed.
      These findings suggest unequal benefits of\\nmobility regarding the collaboration
      ties and highlight the necessity\\nfor implementing policies and initiatives
      geared towards nurturing more\\nbeneficial international research collaboration
      and harnessing the\\ncontributions of mobile scientists.\\n\\nFunding flows

      Dudek**, **Jeroen van Honk**, Isabel Basson, **Carole de\\nBordes**, **Ismael
      Rafols**, and **Rodrigo Costas***\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nMost African countries
      have low domestic research funding and receive a\\nsignificant portion of their
      funding from foreign sources. Consequently,\\nit is of special interest to understand
      funding flows and their\\ninfluence on African research. The Dimensions (Digital
      Science) database\\nbrings together information from publications and projects
      funded by\\nmore than 500 funding agencies from more than 40 countries. By combining\\ngrant
      (project) data and funding acknowledgments in publications, we\\nanalyse funding
      flows to African countries: who are the main funders?\\nwhich countries and
      organizations do they support? what issues do they\\nprioritize? The study will
      also explore the possibilities and\\nlimitations of using Dimensions funding-related
      data for the analysis of\\nfunding flows between global regions.\\n\\nTaming
      complexity: narrative CVs in grant funding evaluations\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n***Judit
      Varga**, **Wolfgang Kaltenbrunner**, and Helen Buckley Woods*\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nThis
      short paper presents preliminary findings from a research project\\ninvestigating
      the uptake and use of so-called narrative CVs in review\\npanels for research
      funding decisions. Our analysis draws on empirical\\nmaterial collected through
      interviews and participant observation in two\\nsubsequent panel meetings of
      a funding program for early career\\nresearchers of the Dutch national research
      council NWO. As expected, we\\nfind that the recent introduction of a narrative
      CV in this program has\\nnot instantaneously transformed evaluative practices.
      Rather, the\\nemphasis on substantive narrative accounts of applicants' achievements,\\ncombined
      with the backgrounding of quantifiable evidence such as\\npublication counts
      and metrics, leads reviewers to gradually\\nproblematize and reconsider previously
      dominant definitions of quality.\\nOur analysis showcases exemplary situations
      in which such reflection\\nbecomes apparent, and it highlights different ways
      in which reviewers\\ntry to resolve newly underdetermined evaluative situations.\\n\\nGeography
      in Scientific Practice and Country Biases\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n***Leyan Wu**,
      Akrati Saxena, and **Vincent Traag***\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nRecent decades
      witnessed a steady increase in international scientific\\ncollaboration, alongside
      debates on nationalist tendencies in scientific\\npractices and global disparities
      in citation flows. Geographical\\nproximity has been shown to influence collaboration
      and citation rates,\\nyet how this affects global patterns remains unclear.
      Addressing this\\ngap, we examine the interplay of geography and country-level
      effects in\\ncollaboration and citations using OpenAlex data. Analysing 1.6
      million\\npublications with 6.8 million collaborations, and 3.7 million citations,\\nwe
      unveil distinct distance dependencies and country-level effects.\\nCollaborations
      between countries decline slower with distance compared\\nto intra-country collaborations.
      Surprisingly, citations between\\ncountries display lower distance dependence
      above a certain threshold,\\nwhile intra-country citations decrease notably.
      These findings suggest\\nthat geographical factors alone do not determine inter-country\\ncollaborations
      and citations, hinting at underlying country-level\\neffects that we will explore
      further in follow-up research. This study\\nadvances our understanding of the
      complex dynamics shaping international\\nscientific engagement.\\n\\nThe use
      of non-institutional email addresses in retracted publications\\nwith special
      attention to mass retractions due to fraudulent peer review\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n***Marc
      Luwel**\_and **Nees Jan van Eck***\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nThe explosion of
      cases of peer review fraud and activities of paper\\nmills pose a systemic threat
      to the integrity of the scientific\\npublishing process. By linking the Retraction
      Watch and Web of Science\\ndatabases, metadata of retracted publications are
      analysed. In the\\nperiod 2007-2021, the use of non-institutional email addresses
      by these\\npublications' reprint authors increased by more than 20%, mainly
      due to\\nan even larger increase from authors with a postal address in India
      and\\nespecially China. Among the journals with the most retracted\\npublications,
      the use of non-institutional email addresses by reprint\\nauthors differs greatly:
      from 7 to 99%. It is also surprising that only\\n36% of the mainly Chinese reprint
      authors of the mass retracted\\npublications in Hindawi journals used a non-institutional
      email address.\\nThese results indicate that caution is recommended and not
      to\\nautomatically red-flag publications as fraudulent when non-institutional\\nemail
      addresses are used.\\n\\nDifferent representations of forest science in bibliographic
      databases\\nand the (in-)visibility of Tanzanian research: applying an epistemic\\n(in-)justice
      lens\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n*Nelius Boshoff, Similo Ngwenya, Amani J. Uisso,
      Susanne Koch, **Rodrigo\\nCostas**, and **Jonathan Dudek***\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nInspired
      by a search for epistemic justice, the study examines the\\nrepresentation of
      Tanzanian forest science in five databases:\\nDimensions, OpenAlex, Scopus,
      Web of Science and a manually compiled set\\nof articles in Tanzanian journals.
      It also ascertains whether profiles\\nof three epistemic elements (alignment
      of research to national research\\npriorities, national region studied, and
      forest type studied) differ\\nbetween the databases. Initial findings of the
      ongoing research indicate\\nthat OpenAlex has the highest coverage of Tanzanian
      forest science\\narticles and that it incorporates all the forest science articles
      of the\\nother databases (excluding those in the Tanzanian dataset). In fact,
      87%\\nof articles in Tanzanian journals do not appear in the other databases'\\nforest
      science collections. This is a form of epistemic injustice as the\\ninvisibility
      of large parts of forest science produced by Tanzanian\\nauthors collectively
      marginalises them and ultimately prevents them from\\nfully participating in
      scientific meaning-making.\\n\\nCoverage and metadata availability of African
      publications in OpenAlex:\\na comparative analysis\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n*Patricia
      Alonso-\xC1lvarez and **Nees Jan van Eck***\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nUnlike traditional
      proprietary data sources like Scopus and the Web of\\nScience (WoS), OpenAlex
      emphasises its comprehensiveness, claiming an\\nextra coverage of humanities,
      non-English languages, and the Global\\nSouth. Strengthening diversity and inclusivity
      in science is crucial for\\nethical and practical reasons. This paper analyses
      OpenAlex's coverage\\nand metadata availability of African-based publications.
      For this\\npurpose, OpenAlex is compared with Scopus, WoS, and African Journals\\nOnline
      (AJOL). We first compare the coverage of African publications in\\nOpenAlex
      against that of WoS, Scopus, and AJOL. We then assess and\\ncompare the available
      metadata for OpenAlex, Scopus, and WoS\\npublications. The analysis shows that
      OpenAlex offers the most extensive\\npublication coverage. Regarding metadata,
      OpenAlex offers a high\\ncoverage of publication and author information. It
      performs worse\\nregarding affiliations, references, and funder information.
      Importantly,\\nthe results also show that metadata availability in OpenAlex
      is better\\nfor publications also indexed in Scopus and WoS.\\n\\nUnexpected
      consequences of Dutch Open Science policy. The effects on\\nDutch scholarly
      publishing\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n***Thed van Leeuwen**, Lieuwe Kool, and Ingrid
      Wijk*\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nIn this study we aim at some unintended consequences
      of science policy\\nregarding open access publishing by Dutch academics. Various
      actors in\\nthe system have advocated different forms of open access publishing,
      and\\nour study will unravel how publishing occurs in various forms of open\\naccess
      publishing (Gold versus Hybrid), and for two types of scholarly\\npublishing,
      the general output of the Netherlands and the output for\\nwhich authors located
      in the Netherlands are corresponding authors. A\\nspecial focus will be on any
      underlying field differences across the\\nDutch scholarly landscape. The study
      shows that contrary to national and\\ninternational efforts, the main focus
      of Dutch academics is on Hybrid\\nopen access publishing.\\n\\nHow does SDG
      Related Research Differ?\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n*Tommaso Ciarli, Hugo Confraria,
      **Ed Noyons**, and **Ismael Rafols***\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nThis paper examines
      the characteristics and impact of research related\\nto the Sustainable Development
      Goals (SDGs), aiming to understand\\nspecific features of SDG-related research
      compared to non- SDG related\\nresearch. The findings reveal that SDG-research
      research, especially on\\nSDGs related to people and society (such as poverty
      alleviation,\\neducation, gender equality, and justice) are more likely to be
      cited in\\npolicy documents, indicating their relevance for public use, and
      to\\nadopt features of open science, such as open access and\\ninterdisciplinary.
      However, these publications are less likely to\\nmention funding and are less
      likely to be cited in academic publications\\ncompared to non-SDG-related research,
      suggesting a disconnect between\\npotentially more impactful research and academic
      recognition. Results\\nreveal gaps in research funding priorities while emphasising
      the\\nimportance of considering the societal relevance of research alongside\\ntraditional
      excellence criteria.\\n\\n### Poster presentations\\n\\nUtilising structural

      work assesses the effectiveness of CSC program through the research\\nperformance
      of CSC recipients and compares it to that of their home and\\nhost countries'
      counterparts. We contextualized CSC awardees'\\nperformance benchmarking against
      their home and host countries'\\ncounterparts, by using normalized mean citation
      score (MNCS) and the\\nproportion of highly cited papers (PP(top 10%)) and the

      scholars' international\\nmobility based on bibliometrics data from Dimension.
      We identify\\n2,446,785 individual researchers affiliated with China from the\\n2000-2022
      period. Based on those data, we find that 2,381,665\\nresearchers are not moving
      in their academic careers, and 65,120\\nresearchers have international mobile
      footprints. Furthermore, after\\ndistinguishing China as an origin country and
      destination country, we\\nfind that China has been losing researchers since
      2000, with the United\\nStates being the main destination for those who move
      internationally.\\nWhat's more, we find that when scholars move, they generally
      do not\\nchange their research fields on a large scale, but some do change their\\nfields,
      particularly in the social sciences. Our study illustrates the\\nlandscape of
      Chinese researchers' international mobility and highlights\\nthe flow patterns.\\n\\nConnecting

      Abstract\\n\\nThis research-in-progress paper examines the alignment between
      public\\ninterest, as evidenced by Wikipedia page views, and the distribution

      peer review in STI research\\n\\n#### Authors\\n\\n***Wolfgang Kaltenbrunner**,
      Felicitas Hesselmann, Serge Horbach*\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nWhile a lot of
      STI research focuses on innovations in scholarly\\npublishing as a research
      object, our own scholarly communication\\npractices often rely on more traditional
      (closed) journal - based pre -\\npublication peer review. In this special session,
      we aim to discuss to\\nwhat extent this is an intentional choice, and in what
      ways we might\\nbenefit from the various affordances of open peer review - in
      particular\\nthe prospect of reusing open review reports across various outlets
      or\\ncontexts. The discussion will be prepared by four short pitches. First,\\nsome
      of the organiz ers of the preceding STI conference will report\\nabout experiences
      with open peer review in the 2023 STI iteration in\\nLeiden (Ludo Waltman).
      A second pitch will collect the existing evidence\\non implications of open
      peer review for diversity and participatio n\\n(Serge Horbach). A third pitch
      will reflect what open and portable\\nreview reports mean for the workings of
      the peer review economy in a\\npublishing context (Wolfgang Kaltenbrunner).
      Finally, there will be a\\npitch on the possibilities of automation in peer
      review and its\\nimplications for openness (Felicitas Hesselmann).\\n\\nThe
      subsequent discussion will focus on the following questions:\\n\\n- What are
      STI attendants' motivations to (not) engage in open review\\n  formats?\\n-
      What are the most important opportunities and challenges related to\\n  implementing
      open and portable peer reviews?\\n- How do open and portable reviews alter the
      development of research\\n  arguments and the engagement with audiences?\\n-

      the past five years, the reform movements for open science and\\nresearch assessment
      have expanded significantly. Increasingly, their\\nagendas overlap , with champions
      of open science seeing current\\nassessment practices as incentivizing behaviours
      that hinder wider\\naccommodation of open science activities among researchers
      (UNESCO,\\n2021, Nosek, 2019, Spector, 2022) . Reform of academic career assessment\\nsystems
      is often earmarked as a site through which to incentivize\\nacademics to more
      fully embrace open ways of working (e.g. EC, 2017,\\nMustajoki et al., 2021,
      Pietil\xE4 et al., 2023, M\xE9ndez and S\xE1nchez -\\nN\xFA\xF1ez, 2023) . It
      is of course easy to say that researchers in general\\nshould be 'recognized'
      and 'rewarded' for open science (in its various\\nincarnations) . But what might
      this look like in practice, what has\\nactually been tried out so far, how might
      researchers in their roles as\\nevaluators and producers of knowledge respond
      to such steering efforts,\\nand what might be the consequences for career evaluations
      and research\\npractices in different research fields and academic institutional\\nsettings?\\n\\nThis
      special session brings together a range of science studies\\nresearchers and
      practitioners working on the emerging intersections\\nbetween open science and
      academic career research assessment reforms ,\\nto present, discuss, and debate
      current and future practices . Each\\nspeaker will be invited to reflect upon

      open data sources include global multidisciplinary infrastructures\\n(e.g. Crossref,
      OpenAlex, OpenAIRE, OpenCitations, an ORCID),\\ndiscipline - specific infrastructures

      This will include the quality (e.g., accuracy and\\ncompleteness) of the data
      available from open scientometric data\\nsources, the use and adoption of open
      scientometric data sources, and\\ndevelopments regarding governance, cooperation,

      will be four\\nfive - minut e talks aimed at offering a diversity of perspectives
      on\\nthe state of the open research information landscape. These talks will\\nbe
      given by the organizers of the special session, highlighting the\\nvarious perspectives
      on openness of research information in the\\norganizing team. One of the talks
      will cover the Barcelona Declaration\\non Open Research Information. The special

      Abstract\\n\\nOver the past decade, there has been a significant increase in
      the\\nnumber of bibliometric analyses published in the peer - reviewed\\nliterature,
      particularly outside of library and information science\\nwhere bibliometric
      s is traditionally situated. While diversity has\\nalways been a strength, it
      also poses challenges in ensuring quality.\\nThe variability in reporting quality
      we currently see may, at least\\npartially, be grounded in the lack of guidance
      on how to conduct and\\nreport bibliometric studies by experts from within the
      field. This\\nspecial session will engage the community in a discussion about
      quality\\nand reporting of bibliometric analyses. Our session relates to the\\nconference
      theme of \\\"Into the great wide open?\\\" in that the level of\\nopenness in
      the bibliometrics community -- our methods and analytical\\ntools, the application
      of our work, our disciplinary backgrounds, and\\nincreasingly more often our
      data sources -- have given rise to a\\nchallenge in ensuring the quality of
      our work and the integrity of the\\nfield. The session will combine an introductory
      panel and an open\\nfishbowl conversation. Five chairs will be arranged in the
      center of the\\nroom, four of which will be occupied initially by our panellists
      . A\\nfifth chair will be left empty for audience members to participate in\\nthe
      conversation , forcing a panellist to leave the fishbowl and invite\\na dynamic
      discussion. This session will be an opportunity for\\nparticipants to provide
      their input and discuss current issues in the\\ncontext of open science with
      a focus on transparency and\\nreproducibility, rigor, robustness and reliability

      research assessment\\nis growing considerably. As part of this, there is increasing
      interest\\nin monitoring and evaluating research cultures and environments (RCE)\\nwithin
      national, program and institutional assessment processes. Moving\\nfrom broad
      aspirations to workable, transparent and legitimate\\nevaluation practices is
      not however straightforward. Meeting these\\ndemands will necessitate relevant,

      needed for monitoring and\\nevaluation. Rapidly unfolding developments around
      RCE indicators thus\\nmerit urgent attention from experts within the STI community.

      respective national\\nresearch systems, and to draw out technical and social
      issues RCE\\ndevelopments are throwing up. These include methodological questions\\nover
      indicator design and data needs, potential disagreements over what\\nto evaluate,

      Abstract\\n\\n*Background*  \\nIn its proposal for a new strategy, \\\\\\\"Towards
      responsible publishing\\\\\\\" ,\\ncOAlition S summarizes: \\\"In the five years
      that have elapsed since the\\npublication of the Plan S principles, the move
      toward full and immediate\\nOpen Access (OA) has become global and irreversible.\\\"
      However, \\\"this has\\nbeen delivered through business models -- such as Read
      and Publish\\nagreements and APCs -- which are highly inequitable\\\". The coalition
      now\\nenvisages a \\\"scholar-led\\\" and \\\"community-based\\\" scholarly
      communication\\nsystem \\\"without author-facing charges\\\". Furthermore, the
      general OA\\nambition of Plan S is \\\"extended to include all scholarly outputs,
      such\\nas preprints and peer review reports\\\" because \\\"the current practice
      of\\npre-publication peer review needlessly delays the sharing of research\\noutputs\\\".\\n\\n*Session
      Goals*  \\nThe aim of the session is to discuss the new focuses and priorities
      of\\nCoalition S based on experiences so far -- including evidence provided\\nby
      the areas of research contributing to the STI conferences. Three\\ntopics will
      be prepared for short introductions to start discussions\\nwith the audience:\\n\\n1.
      \ Empirical examination of the OA transformation so far: The\\n    discussion
      will focus on the empirical evidence pertaining to the\\n    transition into
      Open Access publishing in recent years. A core\\n    question will be how the
      transition aligns with the traditional\\n    research policy criteria of research
      quality and affordability.\\n2.  Challenges with changing the market of scientific
      publishing: The\\n    discussion will focus on new initiatives for scholarly
      publishing,\\n    their foundation and implementation issues, in particular
      the vision\\n    of a \\\"scholar-led\\\" and \\\"community-based\\\" scholarly
      communication\\n    system \\\"without author-facing charges\\\". To what degree
      are the\\n    trends in the present market of scientific publishing aligned
      with\\n    these principles, and how can they be fully aligned?\\n3.  Exploration
      of change trajectories for editorial practices: What are\\n    the experiences
      so far with alternatives to pre-publication peer\\n    review, and how do they
      align with the plurality of existing\\n    community-based efforts, including
      disciplinary differences?\\n\\nMethodological approaches to capture knowledge
      flows between research\\nand public policy: the role of open sources and inequalities

      Cristofoletti, **Rodrigo Costas**,\\n**Ed Noyons**, **Biegzat Murat**, and Cassidy
      Sugimoto*\\n\\n#### Abstract\\n\\nIn today\\\\'s rapidly evolving social landscape,
      which encompasses\\ncritical issues such as climate change, poverty, and technological\\nadvancements,
      the intersection of policy and science holds paramount\\nsignificance. Understanding
      how research informs and shapes policy\\ndecisions has become increasingly crucial,
      sparking discussions on\\nmethodologies for assessing impact. While tools like
      Overton and\\nAltmetric.com have gained popularity, they do not provide neither
      enough\\ncoverture, nor open data, presenting two significant challenges:\\nestablishing
      open - access sources for policy documents and bridging the\\ncoverage gaps
      between the Global South and the Global North. The special\\nsession aims to
      address two specific interests: (i) exploring the\\ndifferences and synergies
      between open and proprietary data sources of\\npolicy documents, and (ii) examining
      the disparities in coverage between\\nthe Global South and Global North regarding
      policy documents and related\\nscholarly outputs within these data sources.
      The proposal aims to foster\\ndebate on potential methodologies for leveraging
      open sources of policy\\ndocuments and for identifying and analyzing inequalities
      in accessing\\nresearch impact on policy. Furthermore, the session seeks to
      explore\\nstrategies for overcoming these inequalities and enhancing the\\nsignificance
      of open data sources in the process.\\n\\nThe session\\\\'s dynamics will involve
      brief speeches from invited guests,\\napproximately 10 minutes each, forming
      a debate panel. Audience\\nparticipation will be encouraged through commenting
      or making questions\\non the topic.\\n\\n### GLOBAL consensus\_meeting\\n\\n[Right

      the inception of ChatGPT in late 2022, the question of how AI will\\nchange
      academia is a concern in almost every discipline. Social media\\nand mailing
      lists alike are flooded with suggestions for new AI-based\\ntools, workflows,
      or seminars. At the same time, many journal\\npublications now come with some
      form of AI involvement -- from analyzing\\nand interpreting data to the drafting
      of whole sections. While it\\nappears likely that future research practices
      will be even more\\nAI-assisted, precisely what this means for the global academic
      system is\\nstill unknown. Here we want to engage in some blue-sky thinking
      and\\npresent a few, hopefully thought-provoking, sketches of the potential\\nfuture
      of scholarly communication.\\n\\n### AI-assisted research could accelerate publishing
      and diversify research outputs**.** {#ai-assisted-research-could-accelerate-publishing-and-diversify-research-outputs.}\\n\\nFor
      example, consider a textual explanation of a table created by a\\nmodel such
      as ChatGPT. The explanation could be generated on the spot by\\nanyone accessing
      a research report and its statistical results online.\\nSuch an on-demand output
      could incorporate the most recent AI model and\\nthe specific preferences of
      the reader, for example language, audio or\\nvisual outputs instead of text,
      the depth of the information, or a\\nparticular statistical framing. Such on-demand
      outputs might further\\ndemocratize scholarly communication, making academic
      knowledge more\\naccessible to everyone, even including the wider public. But
      how will\\nthis affect the future role of fixed and static forms of scholarly\\ninformation?
      Imagine AI could generate an article in any language on\\ndemand or dynamically
      add new studies into a living literature review.\\nThe publication of AI-generated
      content as static journal publication\\nthen seems less useful from this perspective.
      Turning AI models into\\nmere static text generators not only undermines the
      potential of\\nAI-assisted work, it also further increases the burden for reviewers,\\nwho
      face an unprecedented amount of work. So, what does a \\\"publication\\\"\\nlook
      like in such a dynamic world of scholarly communication? Also, how\\ncould peer
      review of dynamic outputs be organized, or is it even\\npossible in such a system?\\n\\n###
      AI-assisted research will affect the role of publishing venues on a systemic
      level. {#ai-assisted-research-will-affect-the-role-of-publishing-venues-on-a-systemic-level.}\\n\\nIn
      our envisioned world, AI could extend a publication system that\\nalready changes
      towards smaller and more diverse outputs and\\nmicro-publication. AI-based tools
      would add on-demand explanations or\\ntranslations to those collections of data
      and figures. This could allow\\nfor more fine-grained searching that considers
      individual parts of\\npapers and their ontologies. Even further, AI-based tools
      might create\\nsyntheses and summaries on even broader scales. Against this
      background,\\nnew patterns of centralization such as research platforms or specialized\\nrepositories
      that contest traditional roles of journals and publishers\\nseem likely. Rather
      than serving publications to human readers, they\\nprovide the databases that
      are used by AI models. So, will we even need\\njournals if human readers can
      retrieve knowledge directly from AI? Of\\ncourse, this also affects evaluation
      regimes where journals have taken\\ncenter stage. We are curious what the future
      roles of academic journals\\nand peer review will look like. Likewise quantitative
      evaluation systems\\nwill be challenged too. How can they account for a more
      dynamic form of\\nresearch communication? What kind of metadata and indicators
      will be\\nrequired for assessing quality and impact?\\n\\n### AI use will challenge
      existing formats for research evaluation and create the need for new forms of
      assessment. {#ai-use-will-challenge-existing-formats-for-research-evaluation-and-create-the-need-for-new-forms-of-assessment.}\\n\\nThese
      ideas make clear that AI use will also fundamentally impact\\nresearch evaluation.
      On the one hand, AI might enhance and support\\ntraditional evaluation procedures.
      The use of AI in writing manuscripts\\nmay for example remove language-based
      bias, e.g., a paper is rejected or\\nrecommended for major revisions due to
      language and communication\\nissues. This could level the playing field for
      non-native English\\nspeakers. As such, existing evaluations might become more
      focused on\\nresearch quality rather than rhetorical ability because of a change
      in\\nthe underlying modes of academic publishing. On the other hand, however,\\nsome
      developments will challenge existing formats and logics of research\\nevaluation
      and create the need for new types of evaluation. The\\nabovementioned shift
      from journals to platforms and AI interfaces would\\nfundamentally undermine
      journals' role as the locus of peer review and\\nas such the guarantors of publication
      quality. Their perceived stance as\\nproxies for research quality would diminish,
      and reputational markers\\nsuch as journal impact factors and journal rankings
      would also lose\\nmeaning. This has substantial consequences for evaluation
      procedures\\nthat are based on the reputation of journals. Alternative indicators\\nsuch
      as article-level metrics might thus become more prominent. Such\\nmetrics might,
      however, also be challenged by highly dynamized\\npublication types which make
      the idea of a research output less discrete\\nand tangible. Today, constantly
      updated literature reviews, versioned\\npreprints, or software publications
      already offer a glimpse of this\\nfuture. While current metrics are focused
      on measuring the performance\\nof outputs (e.g. stable research papers), there
      might arise a need for\\nmore process- or throughput-oriented metrics in the
      future. Such metrics\\ntrack versions of articles over time and consider update
      times, views\\nper version, visualize changes in an article\\\\'s content, and
      even new\\nforms of citations that take into account the potentially changing\\nnature
      of the cited piece.\\n\\nAll in all, we assume that academic publishing will
      become more open and\\ndynamic, and that this will affect the roles of authors
      and publishing\\nvenues. We'd like bibliometricians and evaluators alike to
      constantly\\nask 'what is valuable for the members of the communities we observe?'\\nRemaining
      open to this fundamental question means to meet the AI\\nrevolution creatively
      and independently of how it will be shaped by\\nprivate firms. It can also help
      to set the right incentives and intended\\nconsequences when building new assessment
      frameworks.\\n\\n*Together with our colleagues at DZHW and the wider community
      in science\\nstudies, we want to keep track of how AI will change scientific\\npractice.

      bibliometric analyses. Applying the reporting\\nguideline will assist editors

      by THE are [not\\nconsistent with open\\nscience](https://www.coimbra-group.eu/current-university-rankings-are-not-consistent-with-open-science/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nInstead,
      Kummeling argued, rankings must be \\\"transparent, verifiable and\\nrelevant\\\"
      to the ambitions of an institution.\\n\\nAt CWTS we also [released a ranking\\ntoday](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/launch-of-the-cwts-leiden-ranking-open-edition-2024){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}:\\nthe
      [CWTS Leiden Ranking Open Edition\\n2024](https://open.leidenranking.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      Unlike the THE\\nWorld University Rankings, the Leiden Ranking Open Edition
      is fully\\ntransparent. The data underlying the ranking, obtained from the\\n[OpenAlex
      database](https://openalex.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}, is\\n[completely\\nopen](https://open.leidenranking.com/resources){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      and so\\nare the source codes of the algorithms used to calculate the indicators\\nincluded
      in the ranking.\\n\\nHow many Dutch universities are included in the top 100
      worldwide\\naccording to the Leiden Ranking Open Edition? The ranking on purpose\\ndoes
      not provide a single definitive answer. The answer depends on the\\nindicator
      you are interested in. For instance, suppose you are\\ninterested in the overall
      publication output of a university. The\\nranking then tells you that three
      Dutch universities belong to the top\\n100 worldwide. However, if you are interested
      in the share of the\\npublications of a university that are open access, the
      ranking shows\\nthat 12 of the 13 Dutch universities belong to the top 100.
      In other\\nwords, Dutch universities may not be among the biggest scientific\\npowerhouses
      worldwide, but they do have a leading position in terms of\\nthe level of openness
      of the knowledge they produce.\\n\\n### The need for full transparency\\n\\nThe
      lack of transparency of the major commercial university rankings has\\nbeen
      strongly criticized, for instance in a report of an [expert group\\nof Universities
      of the\\nNetherlands](https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/en/ranking-the-university){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n(of
      which one of us was a member) and in a recent report of the\\n[European University\\nAssociation](https://www.eua.eu/publications/briefings/key-considerations-for-the-use-of-rankings-by-higher-education-institutions.html){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nInstead
      of making the data underlying its World University Rankings\\nopenly available,
      [THE sells the data to academic\\ninstitutions](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/our-solutions/data-and-insights/world-university-rankings-dashboard){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nclaiming
      the data will help them \\\"remain globally competitive\\\". There is\\na painful
      irony here: most of the data THE sells to institutions has\\nbeen produced by
      the institutions themselves. Partly the data was\\nprepared by institutions
      and then submitted to THE, and partly the data\\nresults from surveys completed
      by the academic staff of institutions. To\\nopen the black box of the THE World
      University Rankings, academic\\ninstitutions need to pay THE to get access to
      data they produced\\nthemselves!\\n\\nThe opaque nature of many university rankings
      violates basic principles\\nof open science and is fundamentally incompatible
      with initiatives\\npromoting openness of research information, such as the [Barcelona\\nDeclaration
      on Open Research\\nInformation](https://barcelona-declaration.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nFortunately,
      this is increasingly being recognized, for instance by the\\nuniversities in
      the [Coimbra\\nGroup](https://www.coimbra-group.eu/coimbra-group-joins/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nMoreover,
      universities are starting to take concrete actions. In a\\n[recent\\nstatement](https://factuel.univ-lorraine.fr/node/27154){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nUniversit\xE9
      de Lorraine emphasized the need for a transition to \\\"open and\\ntransparent\\\"
      rankings, referring to the Leiden Ranking Open Edition as\\nan example of such
      a ranking. Moreover, \\\"to contribute to a transition\\ntowards open rankings,
      which provide institutions with the opportunity\\nto regain control over research
      and teaching management indicators\\\",\\nUniversit\xE9 de Lorraine announced
      that \\\"it chooses to withdraw from the\\ncommercial THE and QS rankings by
      no longer providing the necessary\\ndata\\\". After [Utrecht\\nUniversity](https://www.coimbra-group.eu/current-university-rankings-are-not-consistent-with-open-science/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      [University of\\nZurich](https://www.news.uzh.ch/en/articles/news/2024/rankings.html){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nUniversit\xE9
      de Lorraine is the third European University within a year\\nmaking the decision
      to discontinue its participation in the THE World\\nUniversity Rankings.\\n\\n###
      Advancing the transition to transparent rankings\\n\\nHenk Kummeling is completely
      right that university rankings must be\\n\\\"transparent, verifiable and relevant\\\".
      The Leiden Ranking Open Edition\\nis indeed fully transparent and verifiable,
      and by refraining from\\nproviding a ranking of the 'overall performance' of
      universities, it\\nencourages users to focus on the indicators that are most
      relevant to\\nthem.\\n\\nMaking the Leiden Ranking fully transparent took a
      substantial effort\\nfrom our team at CWTS as well as the [external partners
      that we\\ncollaborated\\nwith](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-leiden-ranking-open-edition){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nTo
      support a broader transition to transparent rankings, we would be\\nhappy to
      share the experience we gained in this process with the\\nproviders of other
      rankings, for instance to help them move from closed\\nproprietary bibliometric
      data sources to open alternatives.\\n\\nTo advance the transition to transparent
      rankings, universities also\\nneed to take action. Ideally universities would
      follow the example of\\nUtrecht, Zurich, and Lorraine and discontinue their
      participation in\\nnon-transparent rankings. If this is considered too big of
      a step, there\\nare other smaller steps universities can take, such as changing
      the way\\nthey communicate about rankings, making the data they submit to rankings\\nopenly
      available, and joining the [More Than Our Rank\\ninitiative](https://inorms.net/more-than-our-rank/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nLeiden
      University is currently working on these steps.\\n\\nUniversity rankings create
      complex dilemmas for universities and their\\nleaders. Changing how universities
      deal with rankings requires leaders\\nthat do not run away from their responsibility.
      Last year [Chris\\nBrink](https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20231024130858697){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\naptly
      posed the question all university leaders should think about: \\\"As\\na leader,
      you will be conscious of your legacy ... if there is a chance\\nthat peddling
      rankings may come to be viewed somewhat like smoking or\\ndigging coal or selling
      arms, do you really still wish to be seen in the\\ncompany of the rankers?\\\"\\n\\n[[[Header

      Open Science NL, een zogeheten regieorgaan van NWO, heeft\\nals opdracht om
      de transitie naar open science in Nederland te\\nstimuleren en versnellen, met
      als doel dat open science de norm wordt.\\nHet budget van Open Science NL wordt
      verlaagd van 20 miljoen naar 10\\nmiljoen euro per jaar.\\n\\nWat betekent dit
      voor de transitie naar open science in Nederland? De\\nopen science transitie
      is essentieel om ons onderzoeksysteem in\\nNederland in te richten op een manier
      die aansluit bij de verwachtingen\\nvan de samenleving:\\n\\n- Onderzoek moet
      **solide** zijn. Onderzoek moet op een transparante\\n  manier worden uitgevoerd
      en moet zo veel mogelijk reproduceerbaar\\n  zijn. Kwaliteitscontrole van onderzoek
      moet op een hoogwaardige manier\\n  worden georganiseerd.\\n\\n- Onderzoek moet
      **open** beschikbaar zijn. Onderzoeksresultaten moeten\\n  open beschikbaar
      worden gemaakt, zodat iedereen, zowel binnen als\\n  buiten het onderzoeksysteem,
      snel en gemakkelijk toegang heeft tot de\\n  meest recente onderzoeksresultaten.\\n\\n-
      Onderzoek moet bijdragen aan het oplossen van **grote maatschappelijke\\n  uitdagingen**.
      Dit vereist dat onderzoek, waar mogelijk, samen met\\n  relevante maatschappelijke
      betrokkenen wordt uitgevoerd, zodat hun\\n  kennis en inzichten in het onderzoek
      kunnen worden meegenomen en zodat\\n  zij zo goed mogelijk gebruik kunnen maken
      van de resultaten van het\\n  onderzoek.\\n\\n- Onderzoek moet **doelmatig**
      worden uitgevoerd. Onderzoekers moeten zo\\n  veel mogelijk met elkaar samenwerken
      in plaats van met elkaar te\\n  concurreren. Ze moeten onderzoeksdata en onderzoekssoftware
      op slimme\\n  manieren met elkaar delen. Het publiceren van wetenschappelijk\\n
      \ onderzoek moet op een effici\xEBnte en kostenbewuste manier worden\\n  georganiseerd.\\n\\n-
      Onderzoek moet zijn ingebed in een **hoogwaardige kennissamenleving**.\\n  Open
      science moet stevig verankerd worden in de manier waarop\\n  studenten worden
      opgeleid, zodat we onze kennissamenleving verder\\n  versterken en daarmee de
      grote maatschappelijke uitdagingen waar we\\n  voor staan zo goed mogelijk het
      hoofd kunnen bieden.\\n\\nMet de halvering van het budget van Open Science NL
      komen de\\nbovenstaande zaken in gevaar. Dit is superzonde. Nederland kan het
      zich\\nniet permitteren om achterop te raken in de wereldwijde transitie naar\\nopen
      science!\\n\\n*Ludo Waltman is wetenschappelijk directeur van het Centrum voor\\nWetenschaps-

      cuts on Open Science NL, such a waste!**\\n\\nLast week, in the Dutch National
      Budget, it was announced that [the\\nbudget for Open Science NL will be cut
      by\\nhalf](https://www.openscience.nl/nieuws/budget-open-science-nl-met-de-helft-gekort-de-transitie-naar-open-science-is-onverminderd-belangrijk).\\nOpen
      Science NL, a so-called 'regieorgaan' (directing body) of the Dutch\\nResearch
      Council (NWO), is tasked with stimulating and accelerating the\\ntransition
      to open science in the Netherlands, with the goal of making\\nopen science the
      norm. The Open Science NL budget will be reduced from\\n20 to 10 million euros
      a year.\\n\\nWhat does this mean for the transition to open science in the\\nNetherlands?
      The open science transition is essential to shape our Dutch\\nresearch system
      in a way that aligns with societal expectations:\\n\\n- Research needs to be
      **solid**. Research should be executed\\n  transparently and be as reproducible
      as possible. Quality control of\\n  research should be organised in a robust
      way.\\n\\n- Research needs to be **openly** available. Research results should
      be\\n  made openly available, so that everyone, both inside and outside the\\n
      \ research system, has quick and easy access to the most recent research\\n
      \ results.\\n\\n- Research needs to contribute to solving **major societal challenges**.\\n
      \ This requires research, where possible, to be conducted in\\n  collaboration
      with relevant societal stakeholders, allowing their\\n  knowledge and insights
      to be incorporated into the research and\\n  enabling them to make optimal use
      of the results of the research.\\n\\n- Research needs to be executed **efficiently**.
      Rather than competing\\n  with each other, researchers should collaborate as
      much as possible.\\n  They should share research data and software in smart
      ways. Publishing\\n  scientific research should be organised in an efficient
      and economical\\n  way.\\n\\n- Research needs to be embedded in a **thriving
      knowledge society**.\\n  Open science should be deeply anchored in the way students
      are\\n  trained, enabling us to further strengthen our knowledge society and\\n
      \ to better address the major societal challenges we are facing.\\n\\nCutting
      the budget of Open Science NL by half puts all of the above at\\nrisk. This
      is a great shame. The Netherlands cannot afford to fall\\nbehind in the worldwide
      transition to open science!\\n\\n*Ludo Waltman is the scientific director of

      shortlisted for the [Leo Waaijers Open Science\\nAward](https://ukb.nl/nieuws/shortlist-leo-waaijers-open-science-award-2024/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nFor
      us at CWTS, the Leiden Ranking Open Edition plays a crucial role in\\nour strategic
      agenda. [One of our strategic\\ngoals](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/toward-open-research-information-introducing-the-information-openness-focal-area-at-cwts){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nis
      that \\\"within the next few years, we want our work at CWTS ... to be\\nfully
      based on open research information\\\". To make openness of research\\ninformation
      (e.g., openness of the metadata of research outputs) the\\nnorm, we co-led the
      development of the [Barcelona Declaration on Open\\nResearch\\nInformation](https://barcelona-declaration.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\npublished
      in April this year and [already signed by over 80 research\\norganizations\\nworldwide](https://barcelona-declaration.org/signatories/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThe
      key commitment made by signatories of the Declaration is to \\\"make\\nopenness
      the default for the research information (they) use and\\nproduce\\\". The Leiden
      Ranking Open Edition demonstrates how CWTS is\\nworking on implementing this
      commitment.\\n\\nToday we are proud to publish the [CWTS Leiden Ranking Open
      Edition\\n2024](https://open.leidenranking.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}. This
      new\\nrelease of the Leiden Ranking Open Edition is based on the most\\nup-to-date
      data from the [OpenAlex\\ndatabase](https://openalex.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      Moreover, in this new\\nrelease of the ranking, we have made a major enhancement
      to the web\\ninterface through which the ranking statistics are presented. To
      make\\nthe ranking as transparent as possible, the web interface now offers
      an\\neasy way for users to contextualize the ranking statistics by exploring\\nthe
      underlying publications.\\n\\nBelow we introduce the web interface improvements
      made in the new\\nrelease of the Leiden Ranking Open Edition. We also point
      out how the\\nranking statistics in the Open Edition and in the traditional
      Leiden\\nRanking can be compared, and we briefly discuss next steps in the\\ndevelopment
      of the Open Edition.\\n\\n### **What is behind the numbers?**\\n\\nAt CWTS we
      are frequently contacted by universities that ask us for the\\ndata behind the
      numbers presented in the Leiden Ranking. For instance,\\nuniversities tell us
      that they find it interesting to see how many of\\ntheir publications are classified
      as highly cited, but that this\\ninformation is of limited value if they cannot
      see the actual list of\\nhighly cited publications. In the traditional Leiden
      Ranking based on\\ndata from the Web of Science database, the agreement under
      which CWTS\\nuses Web of Science data does not allow us to present information
      at the\\nlevel of individual publications. In the case of the Open Edition,\\nhowever,
      we use fully open data from the OpenAlex database, for which we\\ndo not face
      such restrictions.\\n\\nConsider for instance Delft University of Technology.
      Suppose we are\\ninterested in the publications of this university in the social
      sciences\\nand humanities (SSH). The Leiden Ranking Open Edition shows that
      in the\\nperiod 2019-2022 6.1% of the SSH publications (co-)authored by Delft\\nUniversity
      of Technology belong to the top 5% most highly cited of their\\nfield and year.
      When we click on '6.1%', the list of the underlying\\npublications is shown
      (see Figure 1).\\n\\n<figure style=\\\"margin-bottom:24px;\\\">\\n<img src=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Figure-1.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"45673\\\"
      />\\n<figcaption>Figure 1. List of SSH publications (co-)authored by Delft\\nUniversity
      of Technology that belong to the top 5% most highly cited of\\ntheir field and
      year (screenshot of the website of the Leiden Ranking\\nOpen Edition).</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nThe
      list includes 249 SSH publications (co-)authored by Delft University\\nof Technology
      that belong to the top 5% most highly cited of their field\\nand year. Importantly,
      many of these publications do not have a full\\nweight of one in the calculation
      of the Leiden Ranking statistics. These\\npublications have a fractional weight
      because they belong to multiple\\nmain fields (not only SSH) and/or because
      they have been co-authored by\\nDelft University of Technology with other organizations.
      Consider for\\ninstance the most highly cited publication in the list. As indicated
      by\\nits citation score (CS), this publication had been cited 622 times by\\nthe
      end of 2023. However, the publication belongs not only to the SSH\\nmain field
      but also to mathematics and computer science, and moreover,\\nof the 35 authors
      of the publication, only one is affiliated with Delft\\nUniversity of Technology.
      In the calculation of the Leiden Ranking\\nstatistics, the publication therefore
      has a weight of only 1/2 \u2715 1/35 \u2248\\n0.01.\\n\\nIn the traditional
      Leiden Ranking based on Web of Science data, we are\\nunable to share the above
      information. To a large extent, the ranking\\npresents black-box statistics.
      The Open Edition solves this problem,\\nboth through the improvements in the
      web interface and [by making all\\ndata and source codes openly\\navailable](https://open.leidenranking.com/resources).
      By offering full\\ntransparency, the Open Edition promotes more responsible
      use of ranking\\nstatistics.\\n\\n### **Comparison with the traditional Leiden
      Ranking**\\n\\nThe [Leiden Ranking Open Edition\\n2024](https://open.leidenranking.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      includes the\\nsame 1506 universities as the [traditional Leiden Ranking\\n2024](https://www.leidenranking.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      that was released\\nearlier this year. To compare the ranking statistics in
      the Open Edition\\nand in the traditional Leiden Ranking, we have created [this
      interactive\\ndashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZmI0YzljYjYtYWZlNy00YzUzLWE1YjYtYjdkNmYwMDUzNjFmIiwidCI6ImNhMmE3Zjc2LWRiZDctNGVjMC05MTA4LTZiM2Q1MjRmYjdjOCIsImMiOjh9){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThe
      dashboard can for instance be used to explore the correlation\\nbetween the
      number of publications of a university in the two editions\\nof the Leiden Ranking
      (see Figure 2).\\n\\n<figure style=\\\"margin-bottom:24px;\\\">\\n<img src=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Figure-2.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"45704\\\"
      />\\n<figcaption>Figure 2. Correlation between the number of publications of\\na
      university in the traditional Leiden Ranking and in the Open Edition\\n(2019-2022,
      fractional counting).</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nFor most indicators, the
      correlation between the statistics in the two\\neditions of the Leiden Ranking
      is quite strong. In some cases, however,\\nthere are substantial differences
      between the two editions of the Leiden\\nRanking. These differences may be due
      to errors in the traditional\\nLeiden Ranking or in the Open Edition. They may
      also result from\\ndifferences in the publications included in the two editions
      of the\\nLeiden Ranking.\\n\\nIn an [analysis performed earlier this\\nyear](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/opening-up-the-cwts-leiden-ranking-toward-a-decentralized-and-open-model-for-data-curation){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nwe
      found that errors in assigning publications to universities are\\nsubstantially
      more likely in the Open Edition than in the traditional\\nLeiden Ranking. Improving
      the quality and completeness of the data in\\nopen scientometric databases is
      a key priority in the open research\\ninformation community. It was discussed
      extensively at the recent [Paris\\nConference on Open Research\\nInformation](https://barcelona-declaration.org/conference/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\n**Next
      steps**\\n\\nLast January [we expressed the\\nexpectation](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-leiden-ranking-open-edition){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nthat
      within one or two years the Leiden Ranking Open Edition will be\\nfully mature
      and will offer a full replacement for the traditional\\nLeiden Ranking. This
      is still our expectation. We are getting\\nincreasingly close to the point at
      which the traditional Leiden Ranking\\ncan be fully replaced by the Open Edition.\\n\\nWhile
      we are moving toward this goal, we will keep working on improving\\nthe Open
      Edition, based also on ongoing discussions about [transparency\\nof university\\nrankings](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/opening-the-black-box-of-university-rankings)\\nand
      [openness of research\\ninformation](https://barcelona-declaration.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      We\\nalso very much welcome feedback from users of the Open Edition. If you\\nhave
      any comments on the ranking or suggestions for improvements, please\\ndo not
      hesitate to contact us using the [contact form on our\\nwebsite](https://open.leidenranking.com/contact){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\n*We

      Soon after\\nthe publication of the dataset, the\\n[procedure](https://github.com/pmongeon/scholars-on-twitter){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      the accompanying paper, two unexpected changes occurred with the\\nsource data
      providers, Crossref and OpenAlex. One made our process\\nimpossible to repeat
      in the future, and the second made the dataset to a\\nlarge extent less usable.
      This short blog post describes those two\\nissues and their impact on the reproducibility
      and usability of the\\ndataset, and how we mitigated those issues to produce
      a new, usable\\nversion of the dataset, that is now available on Zenodo.\\n\\n####
      Reproducibility issue - Musk buys Twitter\\n\\nOne of the consequences of Elon
      Musk buying Twitter in 2022 was an\\nincreased barrier to Twitter data access.
      Two weeks after Crossref's\\nfirst announcement, on February 1st, 2023, to abandon
      the collection of\\nTwitter data, a follow-up\\n[post](https://community.crossref.org/t/dropping-twitter-as-an-event-source/3315){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nconfirmed
      it\\nas[](https://community.crossref.org/t/dropping-twitter-as-an-event-source/3315)stated\\nbelow:\\n\\n\\\"Since
      22 February 2023, we no longer have access to the Twitter API to\\ngather events
      for Twitter. Tweets will be available until the end of\\nFebruary, however we
      are required to remove all data we have collected\\nfrom Twitter and will begin
      to do so in the coming days.\\\"\\n\\nWhat this meant for our dataset is that
      we were no longer going to be\\nable to use Crossref Event Data to collect information
      on accounts\\ntweeting scholarly works - one of the two crucial pieces of our\\nprocess
      - making dataset updates using the same approach impossible. At\\nthe same time
      it also made it a unique dataset in itself, since with the\\ndisappearance of
      the academic Twitter API, it became virtually\\nimpossible to develop similar
      approaches with the currently available\\ntools.\\n\\n#### Usability issue -
      OpenAlex changes all author IDs\\n\\nOn June 20th, 2023, OpenAlex [announced
      a major\\nupdate](https://groups.google.com/g/openalex-users/c/rDA7PWTarVQ/m/mw8Sz8wtAgAJ){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      its author disambiguation system. They then [announced its successful\\nimplementation](https://groups.google.com/g/openalex-users/c/jzlh1Mp_s-g){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\non
      August 11th, 2023. This update introduced a new disambiguation model\\nand a
      live assignment system for authors and affiliations, necessitating\\nthe complete
      replacement of all previous OpenAlex author IDs with new\\nones. Although this
      systemic refresh significantly reduced \\\\\\\"*author\\nsplitting*\\\\\\\"
      and improved the integration of ORCID\\nidentifiers---resulting in a more accurate
      count of authors dropping\\nfrom 127 million to 92 million and a leap in works
      linked to ORCID from\\n15% to 41%---it also introduced challenges related to
      data consistency\\nand traceability. Users who had relied on previous author
      IDs found\\nthemselves facing the need to update their datasets as the old IDs
      were\\nrendered obsolete and began returning 404 errors.\\n\\nWhile bolstering
      the database\\\\'s accuracy and user experience, this move\\nrendered our dataset
      obsolete by invalidating the OpenAlex author IDs\\nthat we had paired with Twitter
      accounts. This illustrates the delicate\\nbalance between enhancing data integrity
      and maintaining continuity for\\nusers reliant on the persistence of identifiers
      and the intricate\\nchallenges of advancing open infrastructures for scholarly
      metadata\\n([Hendricks et al.,\\n2021](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2021/10/27/now-is-the-time-to-work-together-toward-open-infrastructures-for-scholarly-metadata/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\n\\n###
      Updating the Scholars on Twitter dataset in light of these changes {#updating-the-scholars-on-twitter-dataset-in-light-of-these-changes
      style=\\\"margin-bottom:16px;\\\"}\\n\\n#### The matching process\\n\\nFollowing
      the significant update to OpenAlex\\\\'s author identification\\nsystem, the
      Scholars on Twitter dataset, which previously linked Twitter\\nIDs to OpenAlex
      author IDs, immediately became outdated. This called for\\na new approach to
      re-establish these links, as the absence of new\\nTwitter data made it impossible
      to replicate the original method of\\nmatching Twitter profiles with scholarly
      authors. To navigate this\\nchallenge, a bridge was constructed between the
      June 2022 snapshot of\\nthe OpenAlex database---used in the original matching
      process---and the\\nmost recent snapshot from February 2024. We employed the
      public versions\\nof OpenAlex in Google BigQuery made available at the [InSySPo\\nproject](https://www.ige.unicamp.br/insyspo/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      in\\nCampinas, Brazil (see an introduction to this system in [this open\\ncourse](https://yosigo.ugr.es/en/courses/scientometrics-using-scielo-in-big-query/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}),\\nand
      the scripts are available in a [GitHub\\nrepository](https://github.com/pmongeon/scholars-on-twitter){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThis
      bridge utilised OpenAlex work IDs and DOIs to match authors in both\\ndatasets
      by their shared publications and identical primary names. When\\na connection
      was established between two authors with the same name, the\\nnew OpenAlex author
      ID was assigned to the corresponding Twitter ID.\\nWhen direct matches based
      on primary names were not found, an attempt\\nwas made to establish connections
      by matching the names from June 2022\\nwith any corresponding alternative names
      found in the 2024 dataset. This\\nmethod ensured continuity of identity through
      the system update,\\nadapting the strategy to link profiles across the temporal
      divide\\ncreated by the database\\\\'s overhaul.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/1ihgvV5r_ucH7UHqOhVZaud_BhUCDU4SCe-UcBHFvEAg9r_D7A0fekupOpks4J2ev__Xrlc2KPwLGOjvj0qmyWcagrD3LvRR3KBb3BrGMfCTU_uWFWN0scvcU-AAbvTNaFyrNm81GXf-RKZM_96CMzk\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"dbj5n64w0d84\\\"

      Announcing the Scholars on Twitter dataset version 2.0 {#announcing-the-scholars-on-twitter-dataset-version-2.0}\\n\\nOur
      method for re-establishing links between author IDs and Twitter\\nprofiles has
      been notably successful, managing to rematch 432,417 (88%)\\nOpenAlex author
      IDs. This effort successfully restored connections for\\n388,968 unique Twitter
      users, which represents 92% of the original\\ndataset. Of these, 375,316 were
      matched using their primary names, and\\n57,101 through alternative names. The
      simplicity and quick execution of\\nthis approach led to exceptionally favorable
      results, with a minimal\\nloss of only 8% of the original Twitter-linked scholarly
      accounts.\\n\\nWe have republished the dataset in Zenodo and it can be found\\n[here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10905839){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      While\\nthe dataset still cannot be updated with new Twitter profiles and our\\noriginal
      process remains unreproducible, we are happy to bring to the\\nresearch community
      an open dataset of 388,968 Twitter accounts linked to\\nOpenAlex author IDs
      that can be used in the study of the activities of\\nscholars on Twitter and
      science-social media interactions more\\ngenerally.\\n\\nFinally, our case represents
      a cautionary reminder for open research\\ninformation systems like OpenAlex,
      which should work not only to ensure\\nthe persistence of their identifiers
      (for authors, affiliations,\\njournals, works, etc.) but also to support the
      sustainability of other\\ninfrastructures that other communities may build around
      their open data,\\nlike in the case of our dataset or, similarly, the new [Open

      the face of\\ncontradictory evidence coming from different disciplines. Under
      these\\nconditions, advice is sometimes taken without sufficient scrutiny from\\nthe
      more legitimate or conventional disciplinary sources, which may lead\\nto problematic
      decisions.\\n\\nIn this blog post, we present two prominent examples of how
      the use of\\nnarrow disciplinary advice led to questionable policy choices.
      Then, we\\npropose *Concurrent Evidence* as a methodological framework to improve\\nthe
      procedures for the adoption of evidence, building on a deliberative\\nprocess
      of evidence initially developed for legal cases.\\n\\n#### Case 1: Likelihood
      of tsunamis hitting nuclear power plants in Fukushima: physics vs. geology {#case-1-likelihood-of-tsunamis-hitting-nuclear-power-plants-in-fukushima-physics-vs.-geology}\\n\\nThe
      first case concerns the advice on the locations of nuclear plants in\\nFukushima.
      Using as evidence about 100 years of seismograph measurements\\n(i.e. ground
      movements), geophysicists showed that there was no evidence\\nthat a tsunami
      could hit the locations proposed for the nuclear plants.\\nIn contrast, from
      observations of tsunami deposits formed over thousands\\nof years in the physical
      structure of the earth, [geologists concluded\\nthat tsunamis could hit plants
      in those\\nlocations](https://www.aist.go.jp/aist_j/magazine/s0007.html) and
      that\\nthis might constitute a problem. The geological evidence was reported
      in\\n2010 to the government, before the earthquake in 2011. However, the\\nJapanese
      government listened to the advice given by seismology (physics)\\nrather than
      by geology, despite a longer observation record from the\\nlatter -- with the
      well-known disastrous consequences.\_\\n\\n#### Case 2: Infection route of COVID-19\\n\\nThe
      second case concerns advice on how to prevent COVID-19 infections.\\nIt was
      initially thought that COVID-19 infection was due to physical\\ncontact and
      droplets, and therefore appropriate prevention measures were\\nthought to be
      disinfection and shielding. This advice was based on the\\ncommon perception
      of medical doctors, who extrapolated from the dogma\\nthat airborne infection
      is restricted to tuberculosis, measles, and\\nchickenpox. However, it was later
      shown by researchers with expertise in\\nphysics that masks and ventilation
      - the key to prevention against\\nairborne infection - are much more effective
      than conventional\\nprevention measures against infections. Nevertheless, even
      today, the\\nJapanese government has not yet fully acknowledged the airborne
      nature\\nof COVID-19.\_\\n\\nAs a result of this lack of attention to airborne
      infection, and also\\ndue to the resistance to challenge the old medical dogma,
      [prevention\\nmeasures against airborne infection have been insufficiently implemented\\nin\\nJapan.](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/04/21/national/science-health/coronavirus-spread-airborne/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nFor
      example, ventilation systems that can easily accommodate heating and\\ncooling
      are not widely installed in schools. Experts with knowledge of\\nphysics pointed
      out that the National Institute of Infectious Diseases\\nwrongly classified
      the cases of airborne infection into contact or\\ndroplet until 2022, and sent
      an open question to the national institute,\\nwhich was not specifically answered.
      In 2022, after this open question,\\nthe government finally acknowledged the
      key role of aerosol\\ntransmission. But even in 2023, [the government stated
      that airborne\\ntransmission is different from aerosol\\ntransmission](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20220202/p2a/00m/0sc/004000c){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nMeanwhile,
      the infection situation worsened: the annual number of deaths\\nfrom COVID-19
      in Japan in 2022 was 12 times higher than in 2020. In this\\ncase, advice from
      traditional voices within the medical sector took\\npriority over advice based
      on perspectives more grounded in physics.\_\\n\\n### How to deal with expert
      evidence from different disciplines?\\n\\nWe propose that the advice assessment
      in cases such as those above could\\nhave been substantially improved with a
      policy process that was more\\nopen to multi- and interdisciplinary perspectives.
      Here, we review a\\nmethod, *[Concurrent\\nEvidence](https://web.tohoku.ac.jp/hondou/0826/img/concurrent2012(for-general).pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}*,\\nthat
      was [initially developed in\\nAustralia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9DTJ5sYB7A){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      that has been adopted by courts in several countries.\_  \\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/photo-1515187029135-18ee286d815b.webp\\\"\\nalt=\\\"Photo
      1515187029135 18ee286d815b\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\nThe method of Concurrent
      Evidence was inspired by the 'conferences' in\\nhospitals (meeting for discussion)
      held among medical doctors from\\ndifferent disciplines (e.g. surgeon, physician,
      and radiologist) in\\norder to find the best therapeutic approach, for example,
      a cancer\\ntreatment. In several court experiences, the method of Concurrent\\nEvidence
      has demonstrated the importance of [plural\\nadvice](https://www.nature.com/articles/4681029a){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nwhich
      is emphasized by\_Andy Stirling in the context of science policy.\_\\n\\nConcurrent
      Evidence consists of two stages:\\n\\n#### *Stage 1: Joint Conference*\\n\\nIn
      the first stage, called Joint Conference, the questions to be\\ndiscussed among
      experts are provided by the court. The experts\\nautonomously debate the answers
      to the questions and write a Joint\\nReport (by themselves). The experts have
      to clarify on which points they\\nagree and on which points they do not agree.
      For issues they do not\\nagree on, they have to clarify on what and why they
      do not agree.\\n\\n#### *Stage 2: Hot Tubbing*\\n\\nIn the second part, the
      experts are invited to the court simultaneously.\\nThey are usually seated together
      in the witness box; hence the situation\\nis called *Hot tubbing*. The judge
      chairs and both the judge and the\\nlawyers ask questions to the experts based
      on the report of the Joint\\nConference. At this stage, discussions on disagreements
      across experts\\nare encouraged. This process reveals the basis of the different
      opinions\\nof the experts and allows the judge to quickly and easily determine\\nwhich
      evidence is suitable for legal judgement.\\n\\n### Developing science policy
      methods of transdisciplinary evidence inspired by legal experiences\\n\\nWe
      propose that the structured discussion proposed for legal cases may\\nunder
      certain conditions be suitable for the use of evidence from\\nmultiple disciplines
      in policy. This raises a number of issues regarding\\nthe specific choices in
      implementation, such as who makes the questions\\nto the experts and who chairs
      the discussion during the *Hot tubbing.*\\nThese issues can be best addressed
      in specific policy contexts.\\n\\nAs we have seen, undesirable decisions are
      sometimes made due to a lack\\nof attention in policy to the contrasting knowledge
      and answers provided\\nby different disciplines. We have to recognize that policy
      making\\nrequires quick decisions under conditions of high uncertainty and with\\ndisparate
      advice from different sources. This may lead to non-optimal\\nsolutions. Processes
      that consider plural perspectives such as\\nConcurrent Evidence can help in
      reaching better decisions.\\n\\n[[Header image by\\n[@darkroomsg](https://unsplash.com/photos/woman-in-black-fur-jacket-using-phone-47NhZ6jzyZs){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}

      local or regional open data sources like\\n[SciELO](https://scielo.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\n[Redalyc](https://www.redalyc.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      or\\n[LaReferencia](https://www.lareferencia.info/en/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      In a\\nprevious blog post, we recently argued that such richness and diversity\\nof
      data sources call for [decentralised and federated\\nperspectives](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/not-only-open-but-also-diverse-and-inclusive-towards-decentralised-and-federated-research-information-sources){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      the use and adoption of open research information in scientometrics\\nand science
      policy work.\\n\\nRecent initiatives like the [Barcelona\\nDeclaration](https://barcelona-declaration.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      or the\\n[Leiden Ranking Open\\nEdition](https://open.leidenranking.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      represent\\nfundamental milestones towards the broader adoption of open research\\ninformation
      systems in all types of meta-science activities, like\\nmonitoring, evaluation
      or management. These initiatives demonstrate how\\nit is reasonable to \\\"dream\\\"
      that the future of scientometrics and\\nscience policy will be based on open,
      diverse and inclusive data\\nsources, and accessible and usable by a much wider
      range of users than\\nit has ever been (similar dreams were already expressed
      by Katz and\\nHicks in 1997 in their [Desktop\\nScientometrics](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02461128){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\n\\nIn
      the pursuit of such a dream, we have realised that a fundamental gap\\nthat
      still needs to be bridged is the question of how this large\\nlandscape of open
      research information systems could be best accessed\\nand used by all relevant
      users, thus contributing to a more democratic\\naccess and benefit of the availability
      of these open data sources.\\n\\n### Towards democratisation of open research
      information systems\\n\\nWe have so much open data available, but researchers,
      managers and\\npolicy makers from several areas working on problems around science\\ndynamics
      still face the problem of how to effectively access and work\\nwith them.\\n\\nJust
      to illustrate the problem, let's take OpenAlex as an example.\\nOpenAlex offers
      its full database in an [open\\nsnapshot](https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/openalex-snapshot){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nwhich
      opens the possibility for anyone to perform large scale analytics\\nwith the
      database. The problem is that the full snapshot of the OpenAlex\\ndatabase takes
      more than [470 GB of\\nmemory](https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/download-to-your-machine){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\ncompressed
      and about 2 TB uncompressed. This alone represents a\\nfundamental barrier for
      many users to download, process, work and\\nbenefit from the full database;
      the barrier being not only the\\ninfrastructural needs to process and work with
      the data (e.g. large\\ncomputers, computer power, etc.), but also the technical
      skills that\\nsuch an endeavour would require (e.g. programming languages, database\\nmanagement,
      etc.). OpenAlex is aware of this (and in all fairness, the\\nefforts they have
      made to facilitate the access and use of the database\\nare laudable!) and also
      offers an [open\\nAPI](https://docs.openalex.org/how-to-use-the-api/api-overview){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nwhich
      allows users to extract and work with smaller and more sizable\\ndatasets. However,
      the API may still pose technical limitations for many\\nusers, and its usefulness
      may be limited for some of the analytical\\nquestions that may be asked (e.g.
      for large scale researchers' mobility\\nanalytics, or the calculation of field-normalised
      citation scores).\\n\\nAt this stage, some may argue \\\"well, too bad, but
      this is the nature of\\nthings\\\". This does not need to be the case. Instead,
      we believe that in\\naddition to openness and diversity of open research information
      systems,\\nit is also important to\\n[democratise](https://www.oed.com/search/advanced/Meanings?textTermText0=democratize&textTermOpt0=WordPhrase){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nthem
      by making them more accessible and usable to all relevant users who\\ncan reasonably
      participate and benefit from them, thus making truly\\npossible an effective
      [democratisation of the way we manage our\\nscientific\\nsystem](https://cassyni.com/events/AiGH8x2G9ruQkwgfVMnH6M/seminar/abstract){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nIn
      this blogpost we describe our experience in the\\n[InSySPo](https://www.ige.unicamp.br/insyspo/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      project,\\nin Campinas, Brazil, of how concrete steps towards wider and easier\\naccess
      to open research information systems could be developed and\\nimplemented. We
      hope that our experience will encourage other users and\\nstakeholders to engage
      and benefit from the availability of open\\nresearch information data sources,
      and to seek for collective action\\nregarding the sustainability, expansion,
      broad participation and use of\\nthese systems.\\n\\n### The Campinas experience:
      The InSySPo project\\n\\nThe InSySPo project (and\\n[team](https://www.ige.unicamp.br/insyspo/people/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}[)]{.underline}\\nstarted
      in 2020 at the University of Campinas\\n([UNICAMP](https://www.unicamp.br/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"})
      in Brazil, with\\nthe aim of developing research in multidisciplinary fields
      that\\nencompass economics, social sciences, scientometrics and innovation\\nstudies.
      Due to the ambitions and research demands of the project,\\nparticularly around
      the so-called Research Trajectory 4 (focused on *Big\\nData for Assessing Innovation
      processes and Research Innovation\\nPolicy*), we took the firm decision of using
      openly available data\\nsources, including global data sources like OpenAlex,
      but also local\\nones like SciELO, among others.\\n\\nAfter some attempts at
      investigating possible solutions with local\\nhardware and servers, we finally
      opted to go with cloud-based\\ninfrastructures. This was motivated by a need
      to have a running\\noperational infrastructure in a relatively short time and
      to rapidly\\nprovide access to all the members of the project, as well as\\ncollaborators
      and associated partners.\\n\\n### The GBQ infrastructure\\n\\nInspired by the
      solutions already used in small and medium-sized\\ncompanies as well as in the
      data industry as a whole, and considering\\nour limited budget of BRL 500,000
      Reais (about EUR 90,000) for\\ndeveloping the project data infrastructure, we
      opted for using a general\\npurpose cloud computing provider. In our case we
      opted for [Google Big\\nQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      (GBQ - Figure\\n1 shows a screenshot of the main InSySPo GBQ interface), although
      other\\noptions like [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\n[Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      and\\n[Alibaba](https://www.alibabacloud.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} were also\\nexplored.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img
      src=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/bigquery.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"44859\\\"
      />\\n<figcaption>Figure 1: Google BigQuery interface of the InSySPo\\nproject</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n
      \ \\n\\nThe advantages of choosing a cloud computing solution can be summarised\\nas:\\n\\n1.
      \ no need for physical infrastructure, which would have taken time and\\n    substantial
      resources;\\n2.  simplicity of including and providing access to users;\\n3.
      \ computational environments for users to work and analyse the data.\\n\\nThe
      main disadvantage however is that we are using proprietary\\ntechnology (i.e.
      Google), and that there are still computational costs\\nthat need to be considered.
      However, the overall costs of the use of the\\ninfrastructure have been manageable
      within our budget restrictions all\\nthroughout the project's running time.\\n\\nIn
      less than a year, the users of the project already had access to data\\nsources
      like OpenAlex, SciELO or PATSTAT, to name a few.\\n\\n### Our open data sources
      and public datasets in GBQ\\n\\nThe choice of the GBQ allowed us to provide\\n['public](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}'\\naccess
      to all our open data sources. This means that all the open\\ndatabases we have
      already created could theoretically be used by\\neveryone with a Google account.
      That way, databases developed by our\\ngroup can be used by others at their
      own expense, and vice versa (e.g.\\nusers could also combine the GBQ data of
      the [Leiden Ranking Open\\nEdition](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?ws=!1m4!1m3!3m2!1scwts-leiden!2sleiden_ranking_open_edition_2023){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nor\\n[Dimensions'](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/digitalscience-public/dimensions-ai){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\npublic
      versions). Intuitively, this also makes feasible a potential\\nfederation of
      different data sources on a single platform, contributed\\nand used by multiple
      actors.\\n\\nJust by accessing the [project's\\nprofile](http://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=insyspo){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\non
      BigQuery, anyone can see and query the public datasets we have\\ncreated (see
      Table 1 for a full list) at their own needs and pay for\\ntheir own querying.
      [Approximately, 1TB of queries costs US\\\\$5, an\\namount which can pay for
      a few small projects. Further estimations can\\nbe made using the]{dir=\\\"ltr\\\"}[pricing\\ncalculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\n:::

      \ \\n\\nIt is important to note that databases in GBQ can be implemented with\\ndifferent
      degrees of relational implementation. Thus, for example,\\nOpenAlex and SciELO
      have been implemented in full relational models,\\nwhile OpenAIRE is only partially
      implemented in a relational model,\\nstill having some nested fields in JSON
      format, or ORCID which is only\\nin JSON format. Those decisions are related
      to the frequency of use of\\nthe databases as a trade off between cost and performance.\\n\\n###
      How to work with it?\\n\\nWe now have about 200 users that are part of the project
      and have access\\nnot only to the public but also non-public datasets related
      to their\\nactivities and can use the system. The cost of our infrastructure
      is\\nabout 300 US dollars a month. Users work directly on the GBQ interface,\\nparticularly
      to run SQL queries, or using [Google\\nColaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n(Colab)
      (See Figure 2 for an example). For users with large computing\\nneeds, we also
      grant command-line access to specific assets, allowing\\nthem to run queries
      and execute virtual machine tasks on the preferred\\nplatform such as [VS\\nCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      or\\n[DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} by means of access
      to\\nthe Google Cloud command line interface ([GCP\\nCLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)).
      Google Cloud Platform\\nmanages the privileges for users on a fine-grained level.
      The platform\\nuses the concept of roles to define users that are common collections
      of\\nprivileges and it is possible to create roles for your own needs. In our\\ncase
      we add new users by giving them basic access, and then, for every\\nspecific
      asset such as datasets, storage buckets, virtual machines, we\\nprovide specific
      owner or editor access on the asset level.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/colab.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"44883\\\"
      />\\n<figcaption>Figure 2: Google Colaboratory interface\\nexample.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n
      \ \\n\\nColab can be made into a centralised [mix of code and\\ndocumentation](https://colab.google/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      that follows a\\nscholarly work or used standalone. In practical terms, this
      makes it\\npossible to share the full script of a paper, including data collection,\\nanalysis
      and results in one script (see an example\\n[here](https://github.com/insyspo/ordovician/blob/main/Ordovician_studies.ipynb){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\nIn
      other words, it is a straightforward way of making scientometrics\\nwork not
      only easier and more exchangeable, but also more transparent.\\n\\n### The road
      ahead and open questions\\n\\nOur experience in Campinas demonstrated that it
      is indeed possible to\\nbridge the gap between available open research data
      and a wider range of\\nusers, simply by creating and facilitating working spaces
      where users\\nwith different degrees of expertise, technical skills and analytical\\nquestions,
      can directly query and interact with the data. Our experience\\ndemonstrated
      that it is possible for anyone to 1) access and work with\\nthe public datasets
      we have made available (with the only constraint of\\nhaving to pay for their
      own querying computing power); and 2) to develop\\na similar infrastructure,
      with similar approaches and diversity of\\nsources as we have done it in Campinas
      (see 'Do It Yourself' below).\\n\\nObviously, our experience is just a proof
      of concept of how a more ideal\\ndemocratised open research information system
      could take shape. There\\nare still important aspects that will require further
      attention in the\\nnear future to achieve the dream of an open, diverse and
      more\\nparticipatory landscape of open research information systems:\\n\\n1.
      \ More work is needed in the processing, **interconnection and\\n    federation**
      of multiple data sources. As discussed\\n    [before](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/not-only-open-but-also-diverse-and-inclusive-towards-decentralised-and-federated-research-information-sources){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\n
      \   and particularly in the context of Global South research, it is\\n    important
      to maintain and develop the richness of a multiplicity of\\n    data sources
      and perspectives. To achieve this, it is paramount that\\n    existing data
      sources can be easily interconnected, thus requiring\\n    extensive work of
      matching and interconnecting the different\\n    elements of the data sources
      (e.g. publication identifiers,\\n    researchers, organisations, etc.).\\n2.
      \ In the process of democratising the use of open research information\\n    systems,
      **training and capacity building** for users is paramount.\\n    Providing users
      with the basic technical and analytical skills to\\n    work and benefit from
      the data should be seen as a key element for\\n    an effective, ethical and
      responsible use of open research\\n    information. Thus, the development of
      tutorials, courses,\\n    educational material, best practices, etc. should
      be central in the\\n    future agenda of this democratisation.\\n3.  We cannot
      live completely apart from the geopolitical tensions and\\n    we understand
      that Google Cloud infrastructure is not easily\\n    accessible in a few countries,
      for example in China. However, the\\n    underlying technologies used by cloud
      providers are used everywhere.\\n    A very similar framework could be set up
      in Alibaba Cloud services,\\n    for example. A cross integration based on storage
      systems can even\\n    be tried. This is not our most pressing need at the moment,
      but we\\n    invite anyone interested in working with us in this direction.\\n4.
      \ Finally, there are important **sustainability and collective\\n    questions**
      that need to be addressed in the near future. How could\\n    an infrastructure
      like this be sustained? Could we go beyond Google\\n    and consider other non-proprietary
      solutions that could allow users\\n    to engage and work with the same large
      data sets and simplicity we\\n    have experienced? How could the work and costs
      be distributed and\\n    shared among many different partners? Plans for collaborative
      and\\n    more participatory approaches are needed, and initiatives like the\\n
      \   [Barcelona\\n    Declaration](https://barcelona-declaration.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n
      \   represent a decisive step in this direction. Cooperative efforts in\\n    sharing
      costs, platforms, data contributions (e.g. with new data\\n    sources, algorithms,
      matching approaches, etc.) and provision of\\n    training and capacity building
      would be stepping stones towards a\\n    sustainable landscape of open and diverse
      research information,\\n    'democratically' useful for all users and communities
      interested in\\n    open research information.\\n\\n### Do It Yourself\\n\\n-
      If you plan to set up a similar system on the same cloud provider as\\n  we
      did, you should first create an account and activate a billing\\n  account on
      [Google Cloud\\n  Platform](https://cloud.google.com/docs/tutorials){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n-
      After that you can start using the several tools, for example use\\n  [Google
      Cloud\\n  Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/introduction){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n
      \ to keep your datasets\\n- Use\\n  [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/curated-resources/bigquery){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n
      \ as an SQL-based data warehouse\\n- Instead of creating your own infrastructure,
      you can directly use [the\\n  different public datasets we\\n  created](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=insyspo){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n-
      Use [notebooks with Google\\n  Colaboratory](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/instances/visualize-data-bigquery){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n
      \ that access datasets on other parts of the platform\\n- We also have provided
      training on the combination of tools and how to\\n  use SQL for querying the
      datasets via\\n  [YoSigoPublicando](https://yosigopublicando.ugr.es/en/courses/scientometrics-using-scielo-in-big-query/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}:\\n

      Declaration: a call for openness... but also for diversity and inclusion**\\n\\nThe
      launch of the [Barcelona\\nDeclaration](https://barcelona-declaration.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      last\\nweek aims to mobilise the global research community towards making\\nresearch
      information open and accessible. The most common argument for\\nopenness is
      that research information plays a central role in the\\nevaluation of institutions
      and researchers, and in the retrieval of\\nscientific outputs. Given this centrality,
      research information should\\nnot be locked inside proprietary infrastructure
      for science to advance.\\n\\nIn this blog post, we highlight that the [Barcelona\\nDeclaration](https://barcelona-declaration.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      states\\nthat openness is indeed very important, but that openness is not enough:\\nresearch
      information sources should also be diverse and inclusive, in\\nline with the
      [UNESCO Recommendations on Open\\nScience](https://www.unesco.org/en/open-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nResearch
      information should avoid the biases [documented in current\\nmainstream\\nsources](https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3kf9d){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      which\\nare based in Western Europe and North America and tend to make less\\nvisible
      the science produced in other world regions, [especially in the\\nGlobal\\nSouth](https://ariadnaediciones.cl/images/pdf/AccesoAbiertoAngola.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThis
      is highlighted in the [Barcelona\\nDeclaration](https://barcelona-declaration.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      which\\nexplains that decisions are routinely made 'based on information that
      is\\nbiassed against less privileged languages, geographical regions, and\\nresearch
      agendas'.\\n\\nIn short, diversity and inclusion of information are crucial
      for\\nachieving fair and comprehensive monitoring and evaluation. But how do\\nwe
      achieve diversity and inclusion in research information?\\n\\n### **Inclusion
      and diversity require multiple information sources**\\n\\nResearch information
      is understood as including all bibliographic\\nmetadata, as well as metadata
      on other aspects of research such as\\nsamples, materials, research data, organisations,
      funding sources and\\ngrants.\\n\\nIn an ideal world, one might dream of a single
      database that would\\nprovide all this data for all the research across the
      planet. Yet in\\npractice, this is not possible, perhaps not even desirable.\\n**Linguistic,
      institutional, local or regional research agendas and\\nrepresentation biases
      can be more effectively mitigated by ensuring the\\nuse of multiple sources**
      that expand the thematic, geographical and\\nlinguistic scope of research information.
      The multiplicity of sources\\nprovides not only richer data but also broadens
      the cultural\\nperspectives, thus supporting pluralism.\\n\\nWe propose three
      arguments why multiple sources lead to better\\nmonitoring and evaluation.\\n\\n**First,
      coverage (i.e. the number of relevant documents included) is\\nnot very high
      for many world regions**, even in the largest databases\\nsuch as OpenAlex.
      The deficit is particularly acute in territories where\\nmany journals do not
      use DOIs, such as Latin America or parts of Asia\\n(e.g. South Korea), due to
      [economic sanctions on\\ncountries](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0222669){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nsuch
      as Cuba, and to the high costs of DOIs in relation to journal\\nresources. For
      example, only 20% of the documents captured in [LA\\nReferencia](https://www.lareferencia.info){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      (a\\nfederation of repositories) and only 22% of the content published in\\nDiamond
      OA journals in Latin America have DOIs; and [none of the\\npublications](https://dapp.orvium.io/deposits/6442c231903ef57acd6dc640/view){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nfrom
      SciELO Venezuela have DOIs.\\n\\nIn short, the adoption of some standards which
      are believed to be\\nuniversal by the average Western expert is, in practice,
      very difficult\\nin the contexts of many countries. Therefore, databases that
      aim to be\\nglobal should include other Digital Unique Identifiers or the IDs
      of\\nregional databases. The [Decentralized Archival Resource Key\\n(dARK)](https://zenodo.org/records/8091668){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      is a\\nproject by [LA\\nReferencia](https://www.lareferencia.info/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      and\\n[IBICT](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.br%2Fibict%2Fpt-br&data=05%7C02%7Ccommunication%40CWTS.leidenuniv.nl%7C99ef1e82106044366b1908dc644a927a%7Cca2a7f76dbd74ec091086b3d524fb7c8%7C0%7C0%7C638495518657428552%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=YIO3hDM3pPHC4H3ANJgfe6joXD%2BsvyVllK0EPn8%2Bi30%3D&reserved=0){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_that\\nwill
      provide a decentralised infrastructure and governance solution for\\npersistent
      identifiers. Operating on a public good institutional\\nnetwork, dARK will offer
      an inclusive and interoperable approach,\\ncompatible with existing PID infrastructures.\\n\\n**The
      second argument is the richness of the metadata.** A single global\\ninformation
      source cannot support the same degree of detailed metadata\\nthat regional and
      specialised databases can provide for some specific\\nissues. Just as\\n[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      offers\\nricher metadata with regard to medical perspectives, when it comes
      to\\nplace, local information sources provide contextual know-how and a more\\ndetailed
      curation. For instance, the catalogue\\n[Latindex](https://www.latindex.org){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      has rich [journal\\nmetadata](https://www.latindex.org/latindex/ficha/15752){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nto
      help users distinguish among journals with more or less rigorous\\neditorial
      practices. [Redalyc](https://redalyc.org){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}'s\\nopen infrastructure
      provides access to the full text of Diamond OA\\njournal articles [as well as
      structured data in XML\\nJATS](https://www.redalyc.org/redalyc/acerca-de/open-data.html?id=xml){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nincluding
      mathematical expressions in MathML, audio, image, video and\\nother multimedia
      content available in journal articles.\\n\\nMoreover, local databases also produce
      classifications (e.g.\\ndisciplinary) in alignment with national institutions.
      Some local\\nrepositories cover some of the literature (including 'grey' documents\\nsuch
      as policy reports) on socially relevant issues that are relatively\\nneglected
      in the 'international' databases, such as tropical diseases or\\n[local policy](https://doi.org/10.1093/reseval/rvu030){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\n**The
      third argumentfor preserving a variety of information sources\\nispluralism**.
      In a world that is unequal and undergoing serious\\nconflicts, research information
      sources need to remain decentralised to\\naccommodate a variety of perspectives
      on knowledge (local creativity,\\nlanguage, worldviews, histories, etc.), and
      preserve regional\\nindependence. Otherwise, there is a real danger that the
      choices of\\nlarger or dominant groups (for example, with regards to ontologies
      or\\nselections) are adopted by default, without questioning, as has happened\\nwith
      commercial providers with [problematic consequences in research\\nassessment](https://www.nature.com/articles/520429a){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img

      open research\\ninformation sources, with some prominent open research information\\nsources.

      **Opportunities for cooperation among already existing Open Research Sources**\\n\\nThe
      path to open resource information is not about replacing Web of\\nScience or
      Scopus with a single alternative source. On the contrary, we\\nbelieve that
      a **decentralised and federated research information\\necosystem** must be developed,
      so that diverse research information\\nsources contribute to better coverage,
      richer metadata and pluralism.\\n\\nThrough interoperability agreements and
      interconnection of various\\nsources, the use of communication protocols, standards
      and persistent\\nidentifiers, it should be possible to bring together information
      from\\nmultiple sources into applications designed for specific purposes in\\nparticular
      institutions. For instance, LA Referencia and Redalyc are\\n[collaborating to
      connect Diamond OA with Green OA\\ncontent](https://lareferencia.info/en/component/k2/item/299-la-referencia-firma-acuerdo-redalyc){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nto
      improve visibility and research assessment.\\n\\nWith a multiplicity of sources,
      it becomes possible to pose questions in\\na [plural and conditional\\nmanner](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h2fxp){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nrecognising
      that relevant knowledge differs across contexts. Instead of\\ncreating a singular
      \\\"Observatory of Science\\\" with a unique but\\ninevitable partial perspective,
      the multiplicity of sources allows to\\n**organically build up a**\\n[***Multiversatory***](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n**through
      the observation of the** [**pluriverse of\\nknowledge**](https://books.google.es/books?hl=ca&lr=&id=C7zFEAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA1971&dq=mignolo+pluriverse&ots=DtyJQpV4ri&sig=tgHueNIHGBG2qyI3Q4IRK07S0ZY&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=mignolo%20pluriverse&f=false){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nshowing
      different epistemic perspectives created under the lenses of\\nparticular languages,
      disciplines, communities and places, in contrast\\nto mainstream descriptions.\\n\\nThe
      [Barcelona\\nDeclaration](https://barcelona-declaration.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nexplicitly
      supports this plural vision. It advocates that \\\"information\\nfrom different
      sources to be linked and integrated, so that decision\\nmaking can take full
      advantage of all available information and ***can\\nbe based on a diversity
      of perspectives and an inclusive understanding\\nof the issues at stake***.\\\"\\n\\nSimilarly,
      the declaration on research assessment\\n([FOLEC](https://www.clacso.org/en/a-new-research-asessment-towards-a-socially-relevant-science-in-latin-america-and-the-caribbean/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"})\\nof
      the Latin American Council of Social Sciences\\n([CLACSO](https://www.clacso.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"})
      stresses that data\\nsources should \\\"reflect both the production disseminated
      in\\n**international repositories as well as that which is included in\\nregional
      and local databases**\\\".\\n\\nIn summary, there is an agreement that plural
      (i.e. decentralised) and\\ninterlinked (i.e. federated) research information
      sources are the way\\nforward to ensure not only openness, but also diversity
      and inclusion.\\nThe [Barcelona\\nDeclaration](https://barcelona-declaration.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\ncreates
      the momentum for all of us to continue working towards this\\ngoal.\\n\\n[Note:

      **Open Science at CWTS in retrospect**\\n\\nLeiden University sees Open Science
      (OS) as a key element on the path\\ntowards making greater scientific and societal
      impact and fostering\\nresearch quality and integrity. OS is encouraged across
      the university\\nand, to ensure that the transition is based on evidence, the
      Open\\nScience Lab (stay tuned to learn more about it soon!) has been\\nestablished
      at the Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS).\\n\\nAlmost three years
      ago, the former director of CWTS Sarah de Rijcke\\nwrote a [blog\\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/responsible-research-culture-practicing-what-we-preach-at-cwts#20552){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\ndiscussing
      the changes taking place\_at CWTS and introducing the -- then\\nunder development
      -- value-based strategy. In this strategy, the [CWTS\\nKnowledge Agenda 2023
      --\\n2028](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-knowledge-agenda-2023-2028){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nOS
      holds a central position. Most importantly, the knowledge agenda is\\nguided
      by some of the values that underpin the OS movement, like\\ntransparency, responsibility,
      and collaboration. In line with these\\ndevelopments, in September 2021, we
      became the first centre at Leiden\\nUniversity to have its own [Open Science\\npolicy](https://www.cwts.nl/download/f-x2s243.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      The\\nvalue that OS has for CWTS is reflected in [our\\nmission](https://www.cwts.nl/about-cwts)
      as well: \\\"we aim to contribute\\nto the adoption of OS practices\\\". Following
      from \\\"practicing what we\\npreach\\\", this also means that not only do we\_study
      OS, but commit to\\nopen research practices ourselves.\\n\\nBut... what has
      been happening on the work floor? To take a glimpse into\\nwhether and how we
      are practising what we preach when it comes to OS, I\\nhad separate conversations
      with five of my colleagues.\\n\\n### **The different flavours of Open Science**\\n\\nThe
      broadness of OS has been recognised: the aspects it encompasses are\\nmanifold,
      but so are the variety of goals and motivations underpinning\\nopenness in research
      practices. A glimpse into CWTS allows us to observe\\na microcosm representing
      such variety. In an attempt to consolidate the\\ndiverse perspectives of my
      colleagues, I use the five OS schools of\\nthought as devised by [Fecher & Friesike\\n(2014)](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-319-00026-8_2.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_to\\nstructure
      the insights from the interviews (Figure 1).\\n\\nSome colleagues displayed
      an orientation towards a combination of\\n**public and democratic** motivations,
      as our conversations centred\\naround the need for transparency, engagement,
      quadruple helix\\ncollaboration, and inclusiveness (well reflected in this quote:
      \\\"how are\\nthey \\\\[people who are doing research\\\\] thinking about who
      to include or\\nwho to reach with their material?\\\"). They emphasised knowledge\\nco-creation
      and a broader definition of \\\"access\\\" in open access, while\\nalso highlighting
      the need for a case-by-case decision on how and why to\\nbe open. Other colleagues
      put efficiency at the centre, sharing views\\nthat align more with **pragmatic**
      motivations. Open data and open code\\nwere the main topics in these conversations,
      but also the idea of\\nopenness resulting in collective benefit and a wider
      dissemination of\\nresearch outputs. Citing one of my colleagues, \\\"\\\\[being
      open\\\\] helps\\nspreading knowledge, it helps other people getting new ideas\\\".
      The\\n**infrastructure** perspective was also present across the interviews,\\nwith
      a particular focus on the challenges for qualitative researchers to\\nstore
      their data. Some of the concerns around infrastructure are well\\nreflected
      in this quote from one of the interviews: \\\"there are big\\nquestions about
      what are these different data cultures? And how do they\\nrelate or not to existing
      infrastructure? And can we build new\\ninfrastructure that speaks more to specific
      research communities?\\\".\\nFinally, while **measurement**, and particularly
      alternative metrics to\\nevaluate research, is an area of study at CWTS, this
      motivation did not\\nemerge during my conversations with colleagues. In short,
      there is\\ninterest in both the technicalities of OS and the culture that it\\npromotes,
      with some colleagues in a middle ground and others showing a\\nstronger inclination
      towards one or the other.  \\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/5-OS-Schools-for-blog_2024-04-04-093738_iigz.png\\\"\\nalt=\\\"5

      **As open as possible: navigating the challenges**  {#as-open-as-possible-navigating-the-challenges}\\n\\nThe
      first practice that popped up in conversations was **open access**\\npublishing,
      the one that most scholars at CWTS are very familiar with.\\nAccording to our
      OS policy, it is mandatory to make articles openly\\naccessible via open access
      journals or depositing in a repository.\\nRegarding open access publishing,
      concerns were expressed about\\nexpensive article processing charges (APCs).
      Our community is well\\nacquainted with **preprints** and has experience with
      posting them, but\\nit was conveyed that submitting a preprint with collaborators
      requires\\ndialogue to ensure that everyone is supportive of the action.\\nAdditionally,
      there is awareness around **open peer review**, but it\\nseems to be far from
      becoming the norm.\\n\\n**Open data** and the **FAIR** (Findable, Accessible,
      Interoperable,\\nReusable) **principles** came up in all conversations, often
      discussed\\nside by side. While they are well understood, the practical application\\nof
      these principles is not straightforward. This is partly due to the\\nfact that
      making datasets open and useful for others requires\\nconsiderable effort. When
      it comes to Citizen Science involving\\nnon-academic collaborators who also
      collect data, structuring datasets\\ncan become even trickier because of the
      higher heterogeneity. To this,\\nit can be said that our OS policy acknowledges
      this issue and does not\\nmandate data openness when it would require excessive
      effort. On top of\\nthis, reusing existing open data is also seen as challenging,
      often\\nrequiring a substantial time investment. In this sense, it was hinted\\nthat
      **openly sharing and carefully documenting research methods**\\ntogether with
      the data would make them more useful (and reusable!).\\n\\nFor researchers who
      work with code at CWTS, **openly sharing code** is\\ncommon practice. While
      sharing it demands certain commitment, it seems\\nthat over time they have incorporated
      this practice as the norm. In\\ncases where they feel their code is not good
      or useful enough, they tend\\nto keep it closed. In addition, open code shared
      by others is regularly\\nused by our scholars.\\n\\n**Citizen Science** is practiced
      through projects like\\n[CitiObs](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects/citiobs){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nwithin
      the [Citizen Science\\nLab](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/citizensciencelab){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nWhile
      colleagues at CWTS are aware of Citizen Science, it does not\\nappear to be
      practiced widely beyond that. This can be due to the nature\\nof the larger
      part of the research undertaken here. However, there are\\ngood reasons to bring
      citizens to one's research, and as our colleague\\nstated, involving citizens
      from the start is key, especially if you want\\nto have policy decisions change,
      since they are the ones affected by it.\\n\\n### **Driving change: the role
      of CWTS in Open Science**\\n\\nHow can we at CWTS contribute to OS beyond our
      boundaries? My colleagues\\nhighlighted our existing expertise in research evaluation,
      which might\\nbe used for assessing the impact and consequences of OS practices
      and\\npolicies on research. In addition, because of the various international\\nnetworks
      that we are part of, we would be well positioned to engage in\\nadvocacy efforts
      to promote OS. It was also suggested that, as a\\nrenowned centre, we should
      lead by example, which brings us back to the\\nstart and to one of our important
      guiding principles: \\\"We strive to\\npractice what we preach*\\\"*. My colleagues
      at CWTS, driven by the will to\\nenhance research quality and to have a wider
      scientific and societal\\nimpact, seem to be keenly interested in continuing
      to learn and uptake\\nOS practices. We particularly appreciate the opportunity
      to learn about\\nOS by engaging in conversations with other people here. Rephrasing
      one\\nof my colleagues, to have a good OS culture you need to have a good\\nculture
      as a foundation. This goes beyond mere infrastructure or\\nresearch outputs;
      embracing openness and transparency is about fostering\\nopen communication.
      As our policy recognises, OS takes time, but CWTS is\\npositioned to be moving
      in the right direction.\\n\\n### **New to Open Science? Here is a piece of advice

      Science policy as a network\\n\\nGovernment research calls are a key strategy
      for science policies. Using\\nco-word analysis, we built the internal structure
      of research calls,\\ntherefore science policy priorities. [Co-word\\nanalysis](https://doi.org/10.1177/053901883022002003){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nenables
      to visualize the structure of concepts in relation to others.\\n\\nFor instance,
      imagine that a given government ---in its science policy\\nvision--- wants to
      support research on biotechnology applied to\\nbiodiversity, all of that under
      the purpose of building up bioeconomy\\ncapacities in research centres. We will
      name this **Research call 1**.\\nIn a different call, let\\\\'s call it **Research
      call 2**, the government\\nsupports basic research on clean energy, particularly
      solar cells, to\\nstrengthen capacities in knowledge-intensive firms in the
      bioeconomy\\nsector.\\n\\nIn the scenario of Research call 1, biotechnology,
      diversity and\\nbioeconomy are related via their simultaneous inclusion in Research\\ncall
      1. Therefore, each term can now be transformed into a circle (node)\\nconnected
      with a line (link) to the other term, forming a network. The\\nsame happens
      for Research call 2.\\n\\nEven more interestingly, we can see that Research
      calls 1 & 2 have a\\nterm in common in their agenda: bioeconomy. Therefore,
      bioeconomy serves\\nas an intermediary between Research call 1 & 2. In other
      words,\\nbioeconomy is a term with relatively high betweenness centrality.\\n[Betweenness\\ncentrality](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-021-01222-2){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nquantifies
      the importance of a node in a network based on how often it\\nlies on the shortest
      paths connecting other nodes (i.e., fields). It\\nacts like a gatekeeper and
      enables or disables the flow of information\\nbetween different segments of
      a network.\\n\\nIn our context, a research field with higher betweenness centrality,\\nsuch
      as bioeconomy in Research calls 1 & 2, facilitates the connection\\nbetween
      distinct research areas. As we might suspect, some research\\nfields will reach
      a higher betweenness centrality score than others.\\n\\nThis procedure enabled
      us to determine each government's science policy\\npriority by grouping each
      administration\\\\'s research calls, identifying\\nthe strategic research fields
      mentioned and mapping the connections\\nbetween them. We can apply this technique
      to research calls with many\\nresearch fields or the aggregated set of research
      calls by a government.\\nWe show this procedure in the figure below (Figure
      1).\\n\\nTo standardize research fields, we used the [All Science Journal\\nClassification](https://service.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/15181/supporthub/scopus/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nstandard.
      This standard is a Scopus in-house service used by experts\\nwhen a serial title
      is set up for Scopus coverage by classifying the\\ntitle in a subject and area,
      based on the aims and scope of the title\\nand on the content it publishes.
      This standard groups science subjects\\ninto four areas (physical sciences,
      health sciences, social sciences,\\nand life sciences) and 333 fields.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/figure1_2024-03-27-161103_vuou.png\\\"\\nalt=\\\"Figure1\\\"
      />\\n<figcaption>Figure 1. Modelling research priorities in research calls\\nvia
      co-word and network analysis.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n### Unveiling changing
      science policy priorities\\n\\nWe analysed the structure of 389 research calls
      issued by Colciencias\\n(now the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation,
      Colombia)\\nbetween 2007 and 2022. During this period, there were four governments\\nin
      office, with terms of four years each. We analysed the set of calls\\nof each
      government. Figure 2 below shows the periods of each government\\nand the numbers
      of fields with betweenness score\_per area. The areas\\nwith the most fields
      with betweenness centrality score were physical\\nsciences and social sciences
      and humanities, followed by life sciences\\nand health sciences.\\n\\nIt is
      worth noting that not every field has a betweenness centrality\\nscore. Although
      a field can appear in the science policy vision of a\\ngovernment, this does
      not mean that it has a gatekeeper role amidst the\\nflow of information between
      different segments of a network. It can be a\\nperipheral field with a single
      link to another peripheral field with no\\nparticular strategic position.  \\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Figure2_2024-03-28-092826_nwxb.png\\\"\\nalt=\\\"Figure2\\\"

      Short vs. long term priorities {#short-vs.-long-term-priorities}\\n\\nWhen we
      looked at the betweenness score changes for those fields\\nidentified throughout
      2007-2022, we saw that out of 333\_fields, 248 were\\nmentioned at least once
      in all four periods. However, when we selected\\nthose with above median betweenness
      score, the sub-sample was reduced to\\nonly 14. These are the fields with sustained
      relevance for all\\ngovernments and high strategic value as defined by their
      betweenness\\nscore. Interestingly, health sciences were absent from this list.
      The\\nfigure below shows the changing, although consistent, betweenness score\\nof
      those 14 strategic fields (Figure 3).  \\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/image008.png\\\"\\nalt=\\\"Image008\\\"

      research calls (y-axis).</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nWhen we reduce the list
      to the top-five most highly strategic fields\\n---or those fields with the top-five
      highest betweenness centrality\\nscore---for all governments between 2007-2022,
      this results in the\\nfollowing research fields:  \\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/image_new.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"cfc7m5339jvb\\\"
      />\\n</figure>\\n\\n### What could explain our results?\\n\\nIn Colombia, 2015
      marked a year of significant research and development\\ninvestment, reaching
      0.37% of the gross domestic product, the highest\\nsince 1996. This substantial
      budget likely empowered policy-making\\nactors, granting them greater influence.
      Additionally, the expansion of\\nscientific output and interdisciplinary connections
      could account for\\nthe observed interconnected fields between 2015-2018 and
      2019-2022.\\nFurthermore, our findings align with a general trend of transition
      from\\nscience policy government to\\n[governance](https://doi.org/10.3152/030234209X461006){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nemphasizing
      the involvement of a broader range of stakeholders in\\nshaping research objectives
      both within and beyond the scientific\\necosystem. This shift acknowledges that
      science policy priorities may\\nevolve with changes in government and/or the
      formation of political\\ncoalitions.\\n\\n### What do we learn from this?\\n\\nJust
      like governments change, so do their strategic research priorities.\\nThis research
      helps us understand these shifts and identify the\\nmedium-long term research
      fields prioritized in the underlying dynamic\\nof science policy and its governance.
      Science policy acts as a rulebook\\nfor how governments, universities, and companies
      conduct research within\\na country. Ideally, these policies would have a long-term
      vision, but\\ndeveloping nations like Colombia often struggle with this (more\\n[here](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0269116){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand\\n[here](https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-022-01241-1){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\n\\nThe
      research presented here offers a way to understand how policy\\nchanges impact
      research focus and provides policymakers with tools to\\nstrategically allocate
      funding. To come back to our analogy from the\\nbeginning of the post, our approach
      shows how to visualize the music\\nscore currently being played in the science
      policy-musical chair game\\nand what have been the most played genres and how
      pauses might produce a\\nchange in this. As a result, we, the science policy
      players, can learn\\nto dance *salsa* rather than *hip-hop* and be more attentive
      to the\\nposition of the chair so as to keep on playing the game.  \\n\\n[[

      **Findings of the Outlook: more Open Science, but unevenly distributed**\\n\\nTwo
      years after the signature of the OS Recommendation, the [UNESCO OS\\nOutlook](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000387324){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nis
      the first (pilot) global monitoring exercise on the progress of OS\\naccording
      to this value-led perspective.\\n\\n[*(Note that the UNESCO OS Outlook will
      be introduced by Dr. Tiffany\\nStraza in a\_CWTS webinar [on 2^nd^ February,
      2024, 15:00-16.15\\nCET](https://www.cwts.nl/seminars/announcements?article=n-t2q234&title=status-and-trends-in-open-science-open-to-what-and-for-whom-the-unesco-os-outlook){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).*]{.caption}[]{.caption}\\n\\nThe
      good news is that there is a strong trend towards\\\"open\\\" (i.e.\\naccessible)
      scientific outputs: the share of Open Access (OA)\\npublications is quickly
      increasing; the Outlook shows evidence of more\\nsharing of datasets, software
      and educational resources; and an increase\\nin participatory approaches to
      science.\\n\\nThere are, however, two downsides to this growth. First, OS has\\nprogressed
      faster in rich countries and organisations. This is no\\nsurprise: the transition
      towards OS requires significant financial and\\nhuman resources; therefore wealthy
      countries and organisations are in an\\nadvantageous position to adopt OS.\\n\\nHowever,
      this inequality also reflects choices made regarding the types\\nof OS to develop.
      For example, as shown in Figure 2, OA has mainly grown\\nvia the adoption of
      gold and hybrid OA models (with substantial costs\\nfor organisations), although
      diamond and green OA provide more\\naffordable and more equitable alternatives.
      Given differences in\\nresources and distinct publishing traditions, OA in Western
      countries\\nhas advanced via gold and hybrid models, whereas regions such as
      Eastern\\nEurope and Latin America have kept a substantial share of diamond
      OA (as\\nshown in Figure 3). In short, the expansion of gold and hybrid models
      of\\nOA has led to territorial inequality in the visibility and prestige of\\npublications.\\n\\n<figure

      Open Science Outlook</a>.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe second gap
      found by the UNESCO OS Outlook is that monitoring efforts\\nhave mainly focused
      on scientific outputs (primarily in scientific\\npublications, and secondly\_on
      datasets, software and hardware), but much\\nless on OS processes, outcomes
      or values. This means that there are too\\nfew monitoring efforts on axes of
      open science such as the use of\\ncollective infrastructures, participatory
      activities or dialogues with\\nother knowledge systems; and little empirical
      evidence on the alignment\\nof OS progress with values and principles.\\n\\nThe
      dangers of this uneven monitoring (a focus on outputs but not on\\nprocesses
      and values) is the so-called ['streetlight\\neffect'](https://bid.ub.edu/en/40/molas.htm){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}:
      that\\npolicy attention focuses on those activities that can be monitored,\\n[leaving
      behind the\\ndisciplines](https://doi.org/10.1093/reseval/rvv038){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\npractices,
      [topics and\\nterritories](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/latamcaribbean/2017/11/28/journal-based-research-assessments-marginalise-regions-like-latin-america-and-the-issues-most-relevant-to-them/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nwhich
      conduct open science in ways that are not visible to traditional\\nscientific
      indicators. Such bias is particularly problematic because OS\\nas dialogue and
      participation is key to help [aligning research with\\nsocietal problems and\\nchallenges](https://steps-centre.org/blog/to-meet-the-sustainable-development-goals-we-must-transform-innovation/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\n###
      **Opening up the monitoring of Open Science: more activities, more voices**\\n\\nIn
      summary, the UNESCO OS Outlook highlights that OS is making progress,\\nbut
      that this progress is uneven in two senses: it is concentrated in\\nthe rich
      organisations and countries, and it appears to be focused\\n(according to current
      monitoring tools) more on the internal scientific\\noutputs than on knowledge
      creation and exchange with societal\\nstakeholders.\\n\\nThese findings deserve
      some reflection in relation to current OS\\npolicies.\\n\\nIn terms of monitoring,
      new [frameworks are\\nneeded](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/08/14/the-benefits-of-open-science-are-not-inevitable-monitoring-its-development-should-be-value-led/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nthat
      are more comprehensive, more pluralistic and which include value\\nconsiderations.
      In particular, [we have proposed that approaches to\\nassess OS](https://osf.io/4vgq5){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      should aim to address\\nall aspects and values of OS: first, broadening out
      the battery of OS\\nactivities captured (from outputs/papers to processes/engagements);\\nsecond,
      opening up the monitoring to consider the diversity of possible\\nOS trajectories
      (which directions align with stated values? gold or\\ngreen? FAIR or CARE datasets?);
      third [contextualising the description\\nof\\nOS](https://idrc-crdi.ca/en/book/contextualizing-openness-situating-open-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n(e.g.
      high energy physics in Tokyo and applied agriculture in rural\\nIndia require
      different types of OS).\\n\\nIn terms of inequalities, an explicit monitoring
      on inclusiveness and\\ncollective benefits is crucial, because science has historically\\nexcluded
      some social groups (e.g. women and non-Westerners), as argued\\nby scholars
      such as [Sandra\\nHarding](https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/book/1983/Sciences-from-BelowFeminisms-Postcolonialities-and){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nAlso,
      current research systems tend to produce, in relative terms, more\\nbenefits
      for the richer countries (e.g. in the field of [health\\nresearch](https://health-policy-systems.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12961-020-00560-6){target=\\\"_blank\\\"})\\nand

      the Shanghai Ranking, also known as the Academic Ranking of World\\nUniversities
      (ARWU), was launched in 2003, Ton van Raan, director of\\nCWTS at the time,
      sounded the alarm about the [problematic way in which\\nthe ranking uses bibliometric\\ndata](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-005-0008-6){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      for\\ninstance in attributing publications to universities. In response to the\\nShanghai
      Ranking, CWTS decided to launch the [Leiden\\nRanking](https://www.leidenranking.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      aiming to\\ndemonstrate more appropriate ways to use bibliometric data for comparing\\nuniversities.
      While the Leiden Ranking did not gain the same visibility\\nas the Shanghai,
      THE, and QS rankings, it developed a strong reputation\\nfor offering a robust,
      high-quality approach for comparing universities\\nin terms of bibliometric
      parameters.\\n\\nToday, after almost two decades, the Leiden Ranking is going
      to take an\\nambitious next step in improving bibliometric approaches for comparing\\nuniversities.
      The [Open Edition of the Leiden\\nRanking](https://open.leidenranking.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      launched\\ntoday by CWTS, addresses one of the most challenging problems of\\nbibliometric
      indicators: the lack of transparency of these indicators\\ndue to their dependence
      on proprietary data. Together with the [Curtin\\nOpen Knowledge Initiative\\n(COKI)](https://openknowledge.community/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      [Sesame Open\\nScience](https://bmkramer.github.io/SesameOpenScience_site/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nand
      [OurResearch](https://ourresearch.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}, CWTS has\\nrebuilt
      the Leiden Ranking, making it fully transparent by working\\nexclusively with
      open data and open source algorithms. Until now, the\\nLeiden Ranking has always
      been based on data from [Web of\\nScience](https://webofscience.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      a proprietary data\\nsource owned by Clarivate. The Leiden Ranking Open Edition
      uses data\\nfrom [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}, a
      fully open\\ndata source created by OurResearch. To the best of our knowledge,
      the\\nLeiden Ranking Open Edition is the first fully transparent university\\nranking.\\n\\nThe
      importance of transparency of university rankings is widely\\nrecognized. CWTS
      emphasizes the need to be transparent in [its ten rules\\nfor ranking\\nuniversities](https://www.researchresearch.com/news/article/?articleId=1368350){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nTransparency
      also features prominently in the [criteria for fair and\\nresponsible university\\nrankings](https://inorms.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/principles-for-fair-and-responsible-university-assessment-v5.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\ndeveloped
      by the International Network of Research Management Societies\\n(INORMS). These
      criteria were used in the [rethinking the rankings\\ninitiative](https://arma.ac.uk/rethinking-the-rankings/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nLikewise,
      transparency and openness are key elements in the [strategy\\nfor culture change
      regarding university\\nrankings](https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/en/ranking-the-university){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nthat
      is currently being implemented in the Netherlands. More in general,\\nthe [UNESCO
      Recommendation on Open\\nScience](https://doi.org/10.54677/MNMH8546){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      highlights\\nthe need for \\\"open bibliometrics and scientometrics systems\\\".
      In a\\nsimilar vein, the [Agreement on Reforming Research\\nAssessment](https://coara.eu/agreement/the-agreement-full-text/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nstresses
      the importance of \\\"independence and transparency of the data,\\ninfrastructure
      and criteria necessary for research assessment\\\".\\n\\n### **How did we create
      the Leiden Ranking Open Edition?**\\n\\nThe Leiden Ranking Open Edition aims
      to reproduce the traditional Leiden\\nRanking as closely as possible, focusing
      on the [Leiden Ranking\\n2023](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-cwts-leiden-ranking-2023){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nthat
      was published in June last year. The Open Edition includes the same\\n1411 universities
      that are also included in the Leiden Ranking 2023.\\nInstead of proprietary
      data from Web of Science, the Open Edition uses\\nopen data from OpenAlex. This
      data is harvested by OpenAlex from a\\n[variety of\\nsources](https://help.openalex.org/how-it-works/entities-overview){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nincluding
      [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\n[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      and the\\nwebsites of publishers. The Open Edition is based on the [OpenAlex\\nsnapshot](https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/openalex-snapshot){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nreleased
      on November 21, 2023.\\n\\nFigure 1 summarizes the process of creating the Leiden

      \ \\n**Core publications**\\n\\nWeb of Science and OpenAlex differ in their
      coverage of the scientific\\nliterature. Most publications covered by Web of
      Science are also covered\\nby OpenAlex, but OpenAlex covers many publications
      that Web of Science\\ndoes not cover. The traditional Leiden Ranking focuses
      on so-called core\\npublications, which are identified based on a [number of\\ncriteria](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThe
      Open Edition also has a focus on core publications, identified based\\non [similar\\ncriteria](https://open.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nHowever,
      because of coverage differences between Web of Science and\\nOpenAlex, the set
      of core publications considered in the Open Edition\\ndiffers from the set of
      core publications considered in the traditional\\nLeiden Ranking. This is discussed
      in more detail in [this blog\\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/opening-up-the-cwts-leiden-ranking-toward-a-decentralized-and-open-model-for-data-curation){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\n**Publication
      classification**\\n\\nThe Leiden Ranking relies on a detailed algorithmic classification
      of\\npublications into research areas. This classification is used to assign\\npublications
      to main fields and to calculate normalized citation impact\\nindicators. For
      the Open Edition, CWTS created a new classification of\\npublications based
      on OpenAlex data. [This blog\\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/an-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nprovides
      more details.\\n\\n**CWTS organization registry**\\n\\nOpenAlex uses [ROR (Research
      Organization Registry)\\nidentifiers](https://ror.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      for organizations, while\\nthe Leiden Ranking has traditionally used internal
      CWTS organization\\nidentifiers. For the Open Edition, CWTS created a new organization\\nregistry
      by matching CWTS organization identifiers to ROR identifiers.\\nThis was done
      for the 1411 universities included in the Open Edition and\\nfor the [affiliated
      organizations linked to these\\nuniversities](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/a-team-a-stands-for-very-challenging-job){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nAdditional
      links between universities and affiliated organizations were\\nobtained from
      the ROR organization registry. Links between universities\\nand their affiliated
      organizations are presented in a transparent way on\\nthe website of the Open
      Edition (see Figure 2).  \\n\\n<figure style=\\\"text-align:center;\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/VjpSp7dpbdBJKP1aRBdINJ4IzoRdB0W9i1Nyb8ZTbyiT_avm6-892DopQpVUKpwoInEXPBI-NVW7rrW9y-5yKLSlIpv7S68l6xfrYUn87rwcPpM0oHcsi8IeWgyjFEUO5H8UqirPzjgMqpbF4Pcec9A\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"uwb2iwqsd0wv\\\"

      of Amsterdam and its\\naffiliated organisations.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n**
      \ \\nPublication-university links**\\n\\nOpenAlex provides ROR identifiers for
      the affiliations of authors of\\npublications. We linked publications to universities
      by connecting ROR\\nidentifiers obtained from OpenAlex to the ROR identifiers
      of\\nuniversities and their affiliated organizations in the CWTS organization\\nregistry.
      In [this blog\\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/opening-up-the-cwts-leiden-ranking-toward-a-decentralized-and-open-model-for-data-curation){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nthe
      CWTS team presents a comparison between the approach for linking\\npublications
      to universities used in the traditional Leiden Ranking and\\nthe approach used
      in the Open Edition.\\n\\n**Indicators**\\n\\nThe Open Edition includes the
      same bibliometric indicators as the\\ntraditional Leiden Ranking, except for
      [indicators of gender\\ndiversity](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#gender-indicators){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThese
      indicators are somewhat more challenging to produce using OpenAlex\\ndata because
      OpenAlex does not make a distinction between first and last\\nnames of authors.
      This distinction is important for algorithmic gender\\ninference. At the moment
      gender diversity indicators are therefore not\\nincluded in the Open Edition.
      We may add them in the future.\\n\\n### **How to access the data and software**\\n\\nThe
      data used to create the Leiden Ranking Open Edition is [openly\\navailable in\\nZenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10579113){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      under\\na [CC0 public domain\\ndedication](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThe
      data can also be [accessed through Google\\nBigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?ws=!1m4!1m3!3m2!1scwts-leiden!2sleiden_ranking_open_edition_2023){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n(to
      run queries you need to have a BigQuery account and your own\\nproject). Universities
      may for instance use the data to check whether\\npublications have been correctly
      attributed to them. Performing such\\nchecks is not possible in the case of
      the traditional Leiden Ranking,\\nsince this ranking is based on proprietary
      data that cannot be shared\\nopenly.\\n\\nThe source code of the software used
      to create the Leiden Ranking Open\\nEdition is [openly available in\\nGitHub](https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/CWTS-Leiden-Ranking-Open-Edition){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nunder
      an MIT license. A Microsoft SQL Server database system was used to\\nperform
      the data processing and the calculations. The source code\\ntherefore consists
      mostly of SQL scripts.**  \\n**\\n\\n### **How to compare the Open Edition with
      the traditional Leiden Ranking**\\n\\nTo what extent does the Open Edition provide
      results that are similar to\\nthose provided by the traditional Leiden Ranking?
      To address this\\nquestion, we have created an [interactive\\ndashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiODg0YWM2MzEtMmVlNS00NzEyLWE2YjMtMTIxM2Y3ZjMxYTJkIiwidCI6ImNhMmE3Zjc2LWRiZDctNGVjMC05MTA4LTZiM2Q1MjRmYjdjOCIsImMiOjh9){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      which the values of the indicators in the two editions of the Leiden\\nRanking
      can be easily compared.\\n\\nThe interactive dashboard can for instance be used
      to explore the\\ncorrelation between the number of publications of a university
      in the\\ntraditional Leiden Ranking and in the Open Edition (see Figure 3),

      \ \\n\\nIn general, we consider the correlations between indicator values in
      the\\ntwo editions of the Leiden Ranking to be quite strong. However, for some\\nuniversities
      there are large differences between the two editions of the\\nLeiden Ranking.
      In many cases this is probably due to differences in the\\npublications attributed
      to a university. This issue is analyzed in more\\ndetail in [this blog\\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/opening-up-the-cwts-leiden-ranking-toward-a-decentralized-and-open-model-for-data-curation){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\n###
      **What is next?**\\n\\nAt the moment the Leiden Ranking Open Edition is still
      of an\\nexperimental nature. Building the ranking was an incredibly useful\\nexercise
      for our organizations (CWTS, COKI, Sesame Open Science, and\\nOurResearch).
      We also expect to learn a lot from the feedback we hope to\\nreceive from users
      of the Open Edition. Based on the lessons learned, we\\nwill make further improvements
      to the Open Edition. Within one or two\\nyears, we expect the Open Edition to
      be fully mature and to offer a full\\nreplacement for the traditional Leiden
      Ranking.\\n\\nWhile our organisations are making further improvements to the
      Leiden\\nRanking Open Edition, CWTS will continue to release annual updates
      of\\nthe traditional Leiden Ranking based on Web of Science data. In the next\\none
      or two years, we expect the traditional Leiden Ranking and the Open\\nEdition
      to co-exist. In the somewhat longer term, CWTS will make a [full\\ntransition
      to open research\\ninformation](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/toward-open-research-information-introducing-the-information-openness-focal-area-at-cwts){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nWithin
      the next few years, all bibliometric indicators produced by CWTS,\\nincluding
      those in the Leiden Ranking, will be based on open data.\\n\\nThe transition
      of the Leiden Ranking toward open data fits into broader\\ndiscussions about
      openness of research information, responsible use of\\nbibliometric indicators,
      and reform of research assessment. Critical\\nreflection on the value of university
      rankings should be part of these\\nimportant discussions.  \\n\\n### **How to

      Lithuanian).\\n\\nAfter all, how impactful are groundbreaking findings if they
      remain\\nlocked away behind expensive paywalls or inaccessible formats? This\\ndisparity
      demands innovative and responsible metrics that assess both\\nquality and availability,
      promoting fairer and more effective research\\nevaluation.\\n\\nTo address this
      challenge, I embarked on a research journey to\\nunderstand who publishes the
      books submitted for evaluation in different\\ncountries, including my home country
      of Lithuania.\\n\\nSpecifically, I wanted to know whether Lithuanian policymakers
      reached\\ntheir goals by financially incentivising publication with 'prestigious'\\nforeign
      publishers for decades. For this, I needed to identify the core\\nbusinesses
      of the book publishers as well as the countries where\\nresearchers published
      their works.\\n\\nI also wanted to compare Lithuanian results with those of
      other\\ncountries. Thus, I obtained from the Research Council of Lithuania the\\nlists
      of books submitted to the annual research assessments along with\\ntheir ISBNs
      (International Standard Book Numbers).\\n\\nTwo further data sources were necessary:
      first, the lists of books\\nsubmitted for research assessment in another country
      for comparison, and\\nsecond, a source of reliable metadata for these books.\\n\\nBut
      finding suitable data proved challenging. First, no single database\\ncovers
      all publications across all countries. Second, not every country\\nhas a complete
      list of national outputs. Fortunately, the UK's REF\\n(Research Excellence Framework)
      submissions are available to download\\nand explore freely.\\n\\nThen came the
      key breakthrough: I uncovered the power of ISBN codes and\\ntheir metadata within
      the [Global Register of\\nPublishers](https://grp.isbn-international.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nmaintained
      by the International ISBN Agency. Utilising data from this\\nregistry, I not
      only found metadata for every ISBN in my datasets but\\nalso gained valuable
      insights into the publishing landscapes and\\nresearchers' publishing habits
      in both the UK and Lithuania.\\n\\nBefore diving deeper into [the challenge
      of assessing academic\\nbooks](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00284){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      let's\\nfirst review the potential of ISBN codes and the Global Register of\\nPublishers
      for answering questions about scholarly publication norms and\\ntrends.\\n\\n###
      Unveiling the book publishing world with ISBNs\\n\\nOriginally designed for
      book supply chains,\\n[ISBNs](https://www.isbn-international.org/content/what-isbn/10){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nhold
      surprising potential for research evaluation because they embed a\\npublisher
      prefix (Figure 1). This acts like a fingerprint, allowing us\\nto identify the
      true publisher behind the book, unlike the\\nsometimes-misleading information
      on copyright pages.\\n\\n<figure style=\\\"text-align:center;\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/isbn_Figure_1_structure.jpg\\\"\\nstyle=\\\"width:75.0%\\\"
      data-image=\\\"42126\\\" />\\n<figcaption>Figure 1. Structure of an ISBN code,
      where the first three\\nelements identify the actual publisher.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n\_\\n\\nFor
      example, a book might list a specific imprint on the copyright page,\\nbut the
      ISBN prefix reveals it belongs to a larger publishing group. If\\nexperts judge
      books by their publishers, this hidden information can be\\ncrucial for accurately
      assessing research outputs and ensuring fairness\\nacross institutions.\\n\\nAnd
      the best part? The publisher's information is readily available\\nthrough the
      Global Register of Publishers, a free database collecting\\nISBN data from over
      150 agencies in 200 countries. As a registered user,\\nanyone can access details
      about publishers' main activities, which was\\ncrucial for my research.\\n\\nWhen
      I examined the ISBN data for the UK and Lithuanian books in my\\ndataset, I
      discovered a complex world of imprints and multiple brands\\nthat was often
      at odds with the statements on the copyright page. For\\nexample, a single publisher
      like HarperCollins might use the same ISBN\\nprefix for dozens of different
      names, making it hard to tell who is\\ntruly behind the book.\\n\\nThe business
      dynamics of the publishing world add a further layer of\\nintrigue to the story.
      Publishers merge and acquire competitors, and\\nsome imprints move back and
      forth between publishers. The same imprint\\nmay change hands multiple times
      and even be spun off as an independent\\ncompany. This shifting landscape highlights
      the limitations of\\ntraditional evaluation methods that rely solely on publisher
      reputation.\\n\\nBut what does this mean for fairer and more effective research\\nassessment?
      My analysis of ISBN data offers surprising insights about\\nbook publishers
      and their relationships with researchers.\\n\\n### An uneven playing field:
      Open access vs. prestige in scholarly book evaluation {#an-uneven-playing-field-open-access-vs.-prestige-in-scholarly-book-evaluation}\\n\\nThe
      metadata of book ISBNs from the UK and Lithuania revealed a\\ndisparity between
      national policies and publishing practices. While the\\nUK prioritises open
      access, promoting accessibility over publisher\\nprestige, some universities
      still emphasise established publishers for\\nREF submissions. This contradiction
      between policy and practice might\\nexplain why the REF claims neutrality towards
      publisher standing. Since\\nmy study focused on publishing behaviour only, further
      research on book\\naccessibility would be valuable to explore the proportion
      of REF books\\nproviding open access.\\n\\nLithuania, on the other hand, explicitly
      encourages publishing with\\nprestigious foreign academic publishers by offering
      financial\\nincentives. Policymakers assume that prestigious publishers guarantee\\nwide
      dissemination. No policy mentions accessibility. However, my\\nresearch shows
      these incentives have not been effective. To the\\ncontrary, many Lithuanian
      academics struggle to access these coveted\\ntop-tier publishers, and a significant
      portion of their books are\\npublished domestically or through self-publishing
      channels.\\n\\nThe data below illustrates the uneven playing field:\\n\\n- For
      the UK's REF books, the concentration of renowned publishers\\n  potentially
      limits accessibility due to paywalls, despite the national\\n  open access policy
      (Figure 2).\\n\\n<!-- -->\\n\\n- For Lithuanian books, smaller occasional publishers
      collectively\\n  publish more books than the top ten, but some might lack the
      resources\\n  to ensure accessibility through various formats (Figure 3).\\n\\n<figure

      UK scholars rely on established academic\\npublishers, while Lithuanians show
      a shift towards universities,\\nself-publishing, and firms or institutions whose
      core business lies\\noutside publishing (Figures 4 and 5). This seems to indicate
      challenges\\nfor Lithuanians in securing a prestigious publisher, despite the\\nfinancial
      incentive to do so.\\n\\n<figure style=\\\"text-align:center;\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/isbn_blog_Figure_4_UK_2024Feb29.jpg\\\"\\nstyle=\\\"width:75.0%\\\"

      publish? Analysing ISBN data shows that UK\\nresearchers primarily publish in
      Europe, predominantly with domestic\\npublishers (Figure 6). In contrast, Lithuanian
      scholars currently\\npublish more books abroad, with domestic publications declining
      since\\nonly foreign publishers can be awarded the 'prestigious' label (Figure\\n7).
      This may seem to suggest that Lithuanian policymakers succeeded in\\nincentivising
      publisher prestige, but Figure 5 shows that academic\\npublishers produced only
      a quarter of Lithuanian books over 12 years,\\nwhich casts doubt on the policy's
      effectiveness.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/figure6.jpg\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"42226\\\"

      \ \\n\\nBoth countries exhibit a disconnect between policy and practice.\\nHowever,
      the UK\\\\'s REF mandates open access from 2024 onward. This\\npolicy update
      should be a boon to accessibility in UK scholarly\\npublishing. It also offers
      a framework for Lithuania and other countries\\nto prioritise accessibility
      alongside merit of scholarly books.\\n\\n### Advancing research evaluation:
      The scientometric potential of ISBN data\\n\\n*Policy recommendations*  \\nBased
      on my findings, I recommend a multi-pronged approach to address\\nthe identified
      issues in Lithuania\\\\'s book evaluation system.\\n\\nFirstly, since most Lithuanian
      books were produced by universities and\\nnon-professional academic publishers,
      Lithuanian policymakers should\\nstop incentivising publisher prestige alone.
      Instead, they can pilot an\\nopen access policy for research outputs, similar
      to the UK\\\\'s REF, to\\nensure wider accessibility alongside merit-based evaluation.\\nNotwithstanding
      potential concerns about cost or implementation\\ncomplexity, the long-term
      benefits in terms of transparency and\\nefficiency should be carefully considered.\\n\\nSecondly,
      exploring the adoption of a system that leverages ISBN codes\\nand the Global
      Register of Publishers for book metadata could streamline\\ndata collection
      and provide valuable insights into the publishing\\nlandscape.\\n\\n*Contribution
      to scientometrics*  \\nBy unlocking the potential of an important but underutilised
      data\\nsource, my work opens new avenues for scientometrics, policymaking, and\\nbook
      metrics development.\\n\\nScientometricians can now access reliable and comprehensive
      book\\nmetadata, enabling them to conduct more accurate and nuanced analyses
      of\\neach country's research outputs. Policymakers, meanwhile, can learn\\nabout
      the practicalities of the book industry, guiding the development\\nof more effective
      research evaluation practices. Developers of book\\nmetrics can leverage these
      findings to create new and improved\\nindicators that reflect the diverse landscape
      of scholarly publishing.\\n\\n*Future research*  \\nMy work also suggests several
      key research questions to further refine\\nour understanding of scholarly book
      evaluation and publishing practices.\\n\\nFirstly, a comprehensive analysis
      of the accessibility of currently\\nsubmitted books in Lithuania is needed.
      This would involve identifying\\nthe available formats and platforms for accessing
      these books and\\nassessing any barriers that might exist.\\n\\nSecondly, exploring
      the availability and potential sources of additional\\nmetadata for national
      research outputs is crucial. This could entail\\ninvestigating data from national
      libraries, repositories, and other\\nbook-relevant sources.\\n\\nFinally, it
      is essential to determine the feasibility and impact of\\nincorporating ISBN-based
      metadata into existing book evaluation\\nframeworks. Research along this line
      would involve pilot studies and\\ncomparisons with traditional methods to assess
      the effectiveness and\\npotential benefits of this approach.\\n\\nBy addressing
      these key questions, future research can build upon the\\nfindings of my study
      and contribute to the development of more robust\\nand equitable book evaluation
      systems.\\n\\n*I sincerely appreciate the help of Stella Griffiths, executive
      director\\nof the International ISBN Agency, who not only answered practical\\nquestions
      about the standards and their application but graciously took\\nthe time to

      the research and innovation system to the participation of\\nsocietal actors
      is one of the central pillars of the [UNESCO\\nRecommendations on Open\\nScience](https://www.unesco.org/en/open-science/about){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThis
      not only relates to the ethos that scientific knowledge is a common\\ngood that
      all people have the right to benefit from but also relates to\\nthe more urgent
      need to facilitate the participation of actors across\\nsociety towards jointly
      tackling the challenges facing us as a society,\\nfrom climate change to global
      health pandemics. These issues require the\\ninclusion of diverse perspectives
      and insights, as well as co-ownership\\nand action from all stakeholders. Citizen
      Science and other\\nparticipatory practices make a meaningful contribution towards
      both\\nthese aims.\\n\\n### Citizen Science in the Research Landscape\\n\\nThe
      field of Citizen Science has been making great advances over the\\npast decade,
      involving increasing numbers of citizens in monitoring,\\nobserving, and co-researching
      societal issues such as climate change\\nimpacts on the environment and public
      health, and human impacts on our\\nliving environment and nature. Such initiatives
      have been achieving\\nimportant outcomes from fundamental scientific discoveries,
      to\\naggregated data that support evidence-informed policy. The longer-term\\nimpacts
      from participating in such collaborative research can include\\ncommunity co-ownership
      of urgent issues, increased science literacy and\\nlearning, and the empowerment
      of individual and collective action\\ntowards addressing these issues.\\n\\nA
      wide range of practices fall under the umbrella term 'Citizen\\nScience', but
      the common factor is the genuine participation of members\\nof society outside
      academia in any stage of the research processes\\ntowards producing new knowledge
      or other science outcomes - from\\ncitizens & community groups to civil society
      organisations &\\nnon-governmental organisations - across virtually all scientific\\ndisciplines.

      80 new burial mounds, 36\\nkm^2^ of prehistoric fields, approximately 900 charcoal

      level, the European Commission (EC) views citizen\\nengagement practices as
      essential to achieving the strategic aims of the\\nEuropean Green Deal. They
      are woven throughout the funding instruments\\nof Horizon Europe, including
      the European clusters and Missions, and the\\n[New European\\nBauhaus](https://new-european-bauhaus.europa.eu/index_en){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nCitizen
      Science is also being embedded by the EU Member States in their\\nnational science
      policies to involve stakeholders across the quadruple\\nhelix in Research &
      Innovation (R&I) - as can be seen in the Dutch\\n[National Programme Open Science

      \ \\n\\n### The 'Science of Citizen Science'\\n\\nThe Citizen Science Lab at
      Leiden University is helping to mainstream\\nparticipatory research practices
      in all domains by functioning as a\\nknowledge hub for Citizen Science within
      the Open Science Programme, and\\nas a project incubator partnering with researchers,
      policy-makers, and\\nsocietal stakeholders to collaboratively address urgent
      and\\nsocietally-relevant issues.\\n\\nWithin CWTS, the Citizen Science Lab
      functions as a research centre for\\nthe \\\\'Science of Citizen Science', investigating
      for example the 'added\\nvalue' of participatory research practices on the quality
      of research\\nand its outcomes, and evaluating and monitoring the range of impacts
      and\\noutcomes of participatory methods.  \\n\\n### Citizen Science in the CWTS
      Knowledge Agenda\\n\\nAt the heart of the [new CWTS Knowledge\\nAgenda](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-knowledge-agenda-2023-2028){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nis
      the consideration of how research evaluation in its many forms\\nimpacts research
      agenda-setting, notions of quality, and daily practices\\nof research and scholarly
      communication; how meaningful public\\nengagement in research processes impact
      the value and relevance of\\nacademic research; how academia and academic career
      pathways can become\\nmore inclusive and diverse; and how structural inequities
      and lack of\\ndiversity and inclusion in global science can be addressed.\\n\\nThe
      Citizen Science Lab will contribute to tackling these and other\\nquestions
      regarding the engagement of societal actors in knowledge\\nproduction in the
      activities of the Engagement and Inclusion focal area\\nand regarding the impact

      PhD candidates, early career\\nresearchers, and visiting scholars from around
      the world gather at CWTS\\nto pursue their research journeys. The journey can
      be an inspiring yet\\nchallenging experience. It might be filled with research,
      innovation,\\nand personal growth, but it can also be a journey that feels isolating\\nat
      times due to the solitary nature of research. Researchers need to\\nspend extended
      periods working alone, which can lead to a sense of\\ndetachment from the broader
      social and academic community. Loneliness\\ncan be particularly challenging
      for our PhD candidates, early career\\nresearchers and visiting researchers
      who have transitioned to a new,\\nunfamiliar environment. To counter this and
      to create a dynamic and\\nsupportive community, in September, we have started
      an Early Career\\nResearcher (ECR) /PhD council with the two of us, Qianqian
      Xie as the\\nChair and Dmitry Kochetkov as a Council member, in the lead.\\n\\n###
      What does it mean to be a PhD candidate or early career researcher?\\n\\nThere
      is more to being a PhD candidate than just obtaining a degree. It\\nassumes
      full involvement in the research process, from generating ideas\\nto implementing
      them practically. The research process includes not only\\nconducting research
      but also actively participating in academic events\\nsuch as seminars, conferences,
      symposia, and round tables. Here, PhD\\ncandidates can exchange experiences
      with peers, discuss their ideas, and\\nbecome familiar with new methods and
      approaches in their field of\\nknowledge.\\n\\nBeing a PhD candidate also entails
      constant self-development and\\nself-education. It is necessary to continuously
      update one\\\\'s knowledge,\\nmonitor new trends and discoveries in their field.
      Ultimately, all of\\nthis contributes to the development of the PhD candidates'
      professional\\nskills, their readiness for independent research activities,
      and\\nsuccessful careers.\\n\\nTo some extent, the same holds true for early
      career researchers -- not\\nonly the PhD candidates. Early career researchers
      are people taking\\ntheir first steps in a academic career. They have a fresh
      and critical\\nview of the world, full of energy and desire to contribute to
      the\\ndevelopment of science. At CWTS, quite a few colleagues are doing\\nresearch
      without following a PhD trajectory. We realized that we need to\\ninclude them
      as well, since some of their struggles are the same.\\n\\nTo provide support
      on the PhD and early career journey, we established\\nthe ECR/PhD Council.\\n\\n###
      What is the ECR/PhD Council?\\n\\nThe ECR/PhD Council is a small, dedicated
      body (currently consisting of\\ntwo members) within CWTS that brings together
      PhDs and early career\\nresearchers. The Council is committed to the promotion
      of internal\\ncommunication, coordination of supportive and networking activities,
      and\\nsocial cohesion within the ECR/ PhD community. At the same time, the\\nCouncil
      is the formal connection between the ECRs and PhDs and the CWTS\\nPhD coordinator
      and the CWTS management board.\\n\\n### What are we planning to do?\\n\\n- Building
      a Supportive Community: Pursuing an ECR/PhD can often feel\\n  like a solitary
      endeavor. The ECR/PhD Council offers a supportive\\n  community where individuals
      can connect, share experiences, and\\n  provide emotional support to one another.
      The Council members also\\n  take the lead in organizing non-academic related
      meetings and informal\\n  ECR/PhD moments, to provide support for the well-being
      and social\\n  needs of individuals beyond their academic pursuits. For instance,\\n
      \ introducing properly new CWTS ECRs/PhD candidates and discussing\\n  challenges
      met during the PhD trajectory. Every two months we will\\n  have informal ECR/PhD
      moments (on-site), including drinks and\\n  pub-quizzes.\\n- Academic Networking
      Opportunities: The Council provides a platform for\\n  networking with peers,
      mentors and potential collaborators, opening\\n  doors to new research opportunities.
      The Council holds monthly ECR/PhD\\n  internal seminars. These meetings will
      be held in hybrid format and in\\n  English to be as inclusive as possible.
      ECRs/PhD candidates may\\n  present and discuss academic work (proposals, results,
      papers,\\n  posters). We are also delighted to announce that the Council hosts\\n
      \ farewell meetings for early career researchers, providing them with\\n  the
      opportunity to present the research they have conducted during\\n  their time
      at CWTS. Of course, this event is not mandatory but highly\\n  encouraged.\\n-
      Buddy system: New CWTS PhD candidates are now offered the opportunity\\n  to
      be paired with a senior CWTS PhD candidate (a 2nd or 3rd year PhD\\n  candidate).
      External PhD candidates will also benefit from this\\n  system.\\n- Providing
      insights to the CWTS Management Board.\\n\\n### What has happened so far?\\n\\nOur
      experience of joining the ECR/PhD Council has been great so far!\\nIt's not
      just about attending meetings and organizing events. It's all\\nabout being
      part of a supportive and dynamic academic community. Here's\\nwhat the experience
      has been like:\\n\\n- Community Building: We've had the opportunity to connect
      with fellow\\n  PhD students and early career researcher from various fields,
      which\\n  has broadened our perspective.\\n- Professional Development: Workshops,
      seminars and resources offered by\\n  the council are sharpening our professional
      skills and broaden our\\n  knowledge base.\\n- Voice and Advocacy: The council
      gives us a platform to voice our needs\\n  and concerns as PhD candidates and
      early career researchers. It's\\n  empowering to know that our interests are
      being represented.\\n- Collaboration and Leadership: We've already been encouraged
      to take on\\n  leadership roles within the council, which we hope will allow
      us to\\n  develop leadership and teamwork skills.\\n\\nOn October 13, 2023,
      ECR/PhD Council held its first welcoming meeting,\\nat which the new PhD candidate
      and a new postdoc had a chance to\\nintroduce their research. The chairman of
      the Council also introduced\\nall issues relevant to do a PhD at CWTS (i.e.
      facilities and services\\noffered to PhDs, PhD trainings and courses, etc.).
      Even though the\\nmeeting took place on Friday, 13 nothing terrible happened.
      On the\\ncontrary, the meeting was held in a warm, friendly atmosphere.  \\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Welcoming-event-photo.png\\\"\\nalt=\\\"Welcoming
      event photo\\\" />\\n<figcaption>First welcoming event organised by the ECR/PhD\\nCouncil.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nAfter
      the meeting, the council prepared food for all participants, and\\none of our
      colleagues even taught others how to roll spring rolls. It\\nwas not only a
      fascinating cultural experience but also an excellent way\\nto strengthen relationships.

      exceptions (see\\n[here](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-00749-y){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      and\\n[here](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/make-maps-of-research-interactive-detailed-and-open){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}),\\nthese
      approaches are typically based on data from proprietary sources or\\nthey rely
      on non-transparent algorithms.\\n\\nWe introduce an open approach to the algorithmic
      classification of\\nresearch publications. This approach builds on a [methodology
      we\\ndeveloped more than a decade\\nago](https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0532v1){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      While this\\nmethodology was originally applied to closed data from proprietary\\nsources,
      we now apply it to open data from\\n[OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      We make available a\\nfully open classification of publications. The research
      areas in this\\nclassification are labeled using a new labeling approach, and
      the\\nclassification is presented visually using the [VOSviewer Online\\nsoftware](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nWe
      also release open source software that enables anyone to reproduce\\nand extend
      our work.  \\n\\n### Building the classification\\n\\nWe built [our\\nclassification](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10560276){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nbased
      on OpenAlex data, using the\\n[snapshot](https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/openalex-snapshot){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nreleased
      on November 21, 2023. Over the past years, our methodology has\\nbeen used to
      create classifications based on Web of Science and Scopus\\ndata. These classifications
      are available in\\n[InCites](https://clarivate.com/blog/introducing-citation-topics/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand\\n[SciVal](https://www.elsevier.com/products/scival/overview/topic-prominence){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nrespectively.
      Compared to Web of Science and Scopus, OpenAlex has the\\nbenefit that its data
      is fully open and that it offers a broader\\ncoverage of the scholarly literature.\\n\\nTo
      build our classification, we used the so-called [extended direct\\ncitation
      approach](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00035){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin combination
      with the [Leiden\\nalgorithm](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41695-z){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThe
      source code of the software we used is available\\n[here](https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/publicationclassification){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nOur
      classification covers the 71 million journal articles, proceedings\\npapers,
      preprints, and book chapters in OpenAlex that were published\\nbetween 2000
      and 2023 and that are connected to each other by citation\\nlinks. Based on
      1715 million citation links, we built a three-level\\nhierarchical classification.
      Each publication was assigned to a research\\narea at each of the three levels
      of the classification. Research areas\\nconsist of publications that are relatively
      strongly connected by\\ncitation links and that can therefore be expected to
      be topically\\nrelated. At each level of the classification, a publication was
      assigned\\nto only one research area, which means research areas do not overlap.\\n\\nUsing
      the parameter values reported in Table 1, we obtained a\\nclassification that
      consists of 4521 research areas at the lowest (most\\ngranular) level, 917 research
      areas at the middle level, and 20 research\\nareas at the highest (least granular)
      level. We also algorithmically\\nlinked each research area in our classification
      to one or more of the\\nfollowing five broad main fields: biomedical and health
      sciences, life\\nand earth sciences, mathematics and computer science, physical
      sciences\\nand engineering, and social sciences and humanities.\\n\\n|                        |

      values used to build the classification. ]{.caption}\\n\\nGiven the huge size
      of the citation network based on which we built the\\nclassification, the process
      of building the classification was\\ncomputationally demanding. We used a computer
      with 200 GB internal\\nmemory. The process took about 70 hours on this computer.\\n\\nLabeling
      the research areas in an algorithmically built publication\\nclassification
      is a challenging problem. The labeling approach\\nintroduced in our original
      methodology yields a list of five\\ncharacteristic terms for each research area.
      While these terms usually\\ngive a reasonably good impression of the topics
      covered by a research\\narea, our experience is that users often want to have
      a single term that\\nsummarizes what a research area is about.\\n\\nLarge language
      models (LLMs) offer important new opportunities to label\\nresearch areas. We
      therefore used the [Updated GPT 3.5 Turbo\\nLLM](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\ndeveloped
      by OpenAI, to label the 4521 research areas at the lowest\\nlevel in our classification.
      The source code of our software can be\\nfound\\n[here](https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/publicationclassificationlabeling){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nFor
      each research area, we provided the LLM with the titles of the 250\\nmost cited
      publications in the area, along with the prompt shown in\\nBox 1. Using this
      prompt, we asked the LLM to return a label for each\\nresearch area, both a
      short one (max. three words) and a longer one\\n(max. eight words). We also
      requested the LLM to provide a few sentences\\nthat summarize what the research
      area is about.\\n\\n::: {style=\\\"padding:10px; background-color:#F5F5F5;\\\"}\\nYou
      will be provided with the titles of a representative sample of\\npapers from

      of the\\ncluster: \\\\'short label\\\\' (at most 3 words and format in Title
      Case),\\n\\\\'long label\\\\' (at most 8 words and format in Title Case), list
      of 10\\n\\\\'keywords\\\\' (ordered by relevance and format in Title Case),\\n\\\\'summary\\\\'

      evaluation of\\nthe quality of the LLM results, our impression is that the results
      are a\\nsubstantial improvement over the results obtained using our original\\nmethodology,
      or variants of that methodology. We also tried to use the\\nLLM to label the
      research areas at the middle level and the highest\\nlevel in our classification,

      the LLM results are promising, we stress that the use of LLMs such\\nas GPT
      3.5 raises complex legal and ethical questions that require\\nfurther consideration.
      Also, the use of GPT 3.5 requires a payment. We\\npaid slightly less than USD
      50 to label 4521 research areas. We also\\nconsidered the use of GPT 4, but
      this LLM is more expensive and did not\\nseem to yield better results.\\n\\n###
      Visualizing the classification\\n\\nA powerful way to use our publication classification
      is to create\\ninteractive landscapes of science. Figure 1 presents an example
      of such\\na landscape. It was created using the [VOSviewer Online\\nsoftware](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1).\\nWe
      used the software to visualize the 4521 research areas at the lowest\\nlevel
      in our classification. Each bubble represents a research area. The\\nlarger
      the bubble, the larger the number of publications in the research\\narea. The
      distance between bubbles approximately indicates the\\nrelatedness of research
      areas in terms of citation links. In general,\\nthe smaller the distance between
      two bubbles, the stronger the citation\\nlinks between the two research areas.
      The color of a bubble shows the\\nprimary main field to which a research area
      belongs. For instance,\\nresearch areas in the physical sciences and engineering
      (blue) are\\nlocated on the left side of the landscape, while research areas
      in the\\nsocial sciences and humanities (red) are located on the right side.\\nFinally,
      for some bubbles, the landscape also shows the label obtained\\nusing our LLM-based
      labeling approach.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/An-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications_1.png\\\"\\nstyle=\\\"opacity:

      the power of landscapes of science, we use our landscape\\nto show the publication
      activity of our own institution, Leiden\\nUniversity. The landscape presented
      in Figure 2 is identical to the one\\nin Figure 1, except that the color of
      a bubble now indicates the\\nproportion of publications in a research area with

      Opening up bibliometrics\\n\\nWe have introduced an open approach for classifying

      from\\nOpenAlex, our software is open source, and our publication\\nclassification
      is [openly\\navailable](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10560276){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThe

      area {#the-information-openness-focal-area}\\n\\nLast year the Information &
      Openness focal area was established at CWTS.\\nIn this focal area we are concerned
      with the complex interplay between\\ndecision making processes in science, the
      information used in these\\nprocesses, and the nature of this information in
      terms of properties\\nsuch as openness, transparency, inclusiveness, and ownership.
      This\\ncomplex interplay is subject to ongoing disruption from two movements\\nwith
      global aspirations: open science and responsible research\\nassessment. Our
      work in the focal area builds on decades of experience\\nwe have at CWTS in
      using scientometric data to support research\\nassessment and strategic decision
      making in science. Having been at the\\nforefront of developments in scientometrics,
      we not only have a lot of\\nknowledge about scientometric data sources, indicators,
      and algorithms,\\nbut we also have a deep understanding of the role scientometrics
      plays\\nin all kinds of decision-making processes.\\n\\nBuilding on our experience
      and recognizing that decisions in science are\\nincreasingly being made in data-driven
      ways, the Information & Openness\\nfocal area aims to study and promote responsible
      approaches to the use\\nof data in decision making processes in science. We
      are interested in\\nthe properties of the data sources that are being used and
      how these\\nproperties contribute to, or impede, responsible ways of decision\\nmaking.
      The field of scientometrics has a long tradition of working with\\nproprietary
      data sources, especially Web of Science and Scopus. However,\\nthe closed nature
      of these data sources is increasingly seen as an\\nobstacle to transparent and
      responsible decision making, for instance in\\nthe context of research assessment.
      In the Information & Openness focal\\narea we are therefore particularly interested
      in studying and promoting\\nopenness of scientometric data, and of research
      information more\\ngenerally.\\n\\n### **Three pillars**\\n\\nIn line with the
      organization of the\_[broader knowledge agenda of\\nCWTS](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-focal-areas-of-cwts){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nour
      work in the Information & Openness focal area is organized in three\\npillars:
      understanding, intervening, and practicing. In the box below we\\noutline our
      plans for each of these pillars.\\n\\n<table>\\n<colgroup>\\n<col style=\\\"width:
      100%\\\" />\\n</colgroup>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><p><strong>Understanding</strong></p>\\n<p>In
      the understanding pillar we perform research projects with the\\nbroad goal
      of developing a comprehensive and critical understanding of\\nthe open research
      information landscape. Based on our scientometric\\nexpertise, some projects
      in this pillar may focus on systematically\\nmonitoring and tracking the availability
      of open research information.\\nDrawing on our expertise in sociology, anthropology,
      and science and\\ntechnology studies, other projects may be aimed at describing
      and\\nexplaining what shapes, enables, and constrains the spread, or\\nnon-spread,
      of open information practices.</p>\\n<p><strong>Intervening</strong></p>\\n<p>In
      the intervening pillar we take concrete actions to advance\\nopenness of research
      information, aiming to make openness of research\\ninformation the norm and
      to enable more transparent and responsible\\napproaches to decision making in
      science. An example is the\\ntransformation of the <a href=\\\"https://www.leidenranking.com/\\\">CWTS\\nLeiden
      Ranking</a> to a tool that is entirely based on open data,\\nresulting in a
      fully transparent and reproducible ranking. The first\\nrelease of the Open
      Edition of the Leiden Ranking will take place later\\nthis month, on January
      30. Another example is the launch of the course<a\\nhref=\\\"https://www.cwts.nl/education/cwts-course-program/scientometrics-using-open-data\\\"><em>Scientometrics\\nUsing
      Open Data</em></a>, in close collaboration with colleagues at the\\n<a href=\\\"https://openknowledge.community/\\\">Curtin
      Open Knowledge\\nInitiative (COKI)</a>. The first edition of this course took
      place in\\nNovember last year, and a next edition will be organized in March
      this\\nyear. Other actions to advance openness of research information are\\ncurrently
      in preparation. We expect to share some announcements in the\\ncoming months.</p>\\n<p><strong>Practicing</strong></p>\\n<p>Following
      the idea of \u2018practice what we preach\u2019, the practicing\\npillar focuses
      on implementing openness of research information in our\\nown way of working
      at CWTS. Within the next few years, we want our work\\nat CWTS (including <a
      href=\\\"https://cwtsbv.nl/\\\">CWTS BV</a>) to be fully\\nbased on open research
      information. In particular, our aim is that\\nfuture scientometric analyses
      performed by our center will use only data\\nfrom open sources, such as Crossref,
      DataCite, ORCID, OpenAlex,\\nOpenCitations, OpenAIRE, and others. This is part
      of a broader ambition\\nto open up the work we do at CWTS, for instance in the
      way we\\ncommunicate about our research and about other activities of our center.\\nThis
      will also include a revision and expansion of our policies for <a\\nhref=\\\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/cwts-open-science-policy\\\">open\\nscience</a>
      and <a\\nhref=\\\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/cwts-research-data-management-guidelines\\\">research\\ndata
      management</a>.</p></td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n\\n### **Our way of
      working**\\n\\nThe team of the Information & Openness focal area consists of
      more than\\n20 CWTS colleagues. Some of us are focused primarily on activities
      in\\nthe understanding pillar. Others are more focused on the intervening or\\npracticing
      pillars. We meet once every two weeks to discuss the latest\\ndevelopments around
      open research information, to share updates on\\nongoing projects and other
      activities, and to make plans for new\\ninitiatives.\\n\\nOur work also aims
      to contribute to strengthening the other two focal\\nareas of CWTS: [Engagement
      &\\nInclusion](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-focal-area-engagement-and-inclusion-a-vision-and-roadmap){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      Evaluation & Culture. Through the [UNESCO Lab on Diversity and\\nInclusion in
      Global\\nScience](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nwe
      for instance connect some of the work we do in the Information &\\nOpenness
      and Engagement & Inclusion focal areas. Likewise, our work in\\nthe [GraspOS
      project](https://graspos.eu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} and the\\n[CoARA working

      the value of cross fertilization between the Information &\\nOpenness and Evaluation
      & Culture focal areas.\\n\\nWe are also setting up collaborations with external
      partners working on\\nopen research information. Many organizations are doing
      crucial work in\\nthis area. This ranges from research groups that study openness
      of\\nresearch information to organizations that provide infrastructures for\\nopen
      research information and organizations that put the use of open\\nresearch information
      into practice (e.g.,\\n[CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/en/cnrsinfo/cnrs-has-unsubscribed-scopus-publications-database){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\n[COKI](https://open.coki.ac/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},

      in the heart of the Andes, where I find\\nmyself reflecting on two transformative
      events in my scientific journey:\\nthe CWTS Scientometrics Summer School (CS^3^)
      and the 27th International\\nConference on Science, Technology, and Innovation
      Indicators (STI 2023).\\nAs a bibliometrics enthusiast for the past two decades,
      this experience\\nhas been nothing short of a revelation---a journey that prompted
      me to\\nquestion the very fabric of scientific evaluation and metrics.\\n\\nTwo
      decades ago, my foray into bibliometrics was marked by conventional\\nsurvey
      field research. Fast forward ten years, and I realized the\\nuntapped potential
      of bibliometrics in advancing Library and Information\\nScience (LIS). My maiden
      bibliometric study delved into the\\ncontroversial realm of the h-index, assessing
      its utility in gauging the\\nscientific output of Peruvian researchers. The
      journey took a pivotal\\nturn in 2015 when I attended the \\\"Measuring Science
      and Research\\nPerformance\\\"\_course at CWTS in Leiden, a week that unraveled
      the\\nlimitations and detrimental consequences associated with relying on the\\nh-index
      for critical decisions like research grants or promotions.\\n\\nWhy the focus
      on the h-index? Because, like the widely contested journal\\nimpact factor,
      it stands as one of the most popular yet frequently\\nmisused bibliometric indicators.
      Over almost a decade of dedicated\\nbibliometric studies, I couldn\\\\'t ignore
      the grim reality in many South\\nAmerican countries---bibliometric reports often
      perpetuate the status\\nquo, hindering scientific progress. Indicators, meant
      to guide and\\ninform, had become perverse incentives. Researchers, chasing
      elusive\\ncitations, prioritized studies that fit into pre-existing frameworks\\nrather
      than addressing pressing regional and local needs.\\n\\nEven workshops advocating
      for open science, while championing\\ntransparency and accessibility, often
      fell short. Discussions on\\nalternative indicators typically revolve around
      metrics tied to\\ndownloads or citations from open information sources. While
      open-access\\npublishing dominates the discourse on open science practices,
      few\\nconsider the potential of data sharing and code transparency: for\\nexample,
      sharing bibliographic datasets or the R/Stata codes essential\\nfor transparent
      data analysis.  \\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/day-2-vevrvolg-11.jpg\\\"\\nalt=\\\"Day
      2 vevrvolg 11\\\" />\\n<figcaption>The author presenting at the STI 2023\\nconference.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nEight
      years after my inaugural visit to Leiden, I had the privilege of\\nreturning
      to participate in the\\n[CS3](https://www.cwts.nl/education/cwts-course-program/cwts-scientometrics-summer-school-2023){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      the [STI 2023](https://www.sti2023.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}. These\\nevents
      were crucibles of intellectual exchange, where I encountered a\\nwealth of perspectives
      that ignited new possibilities for my own\\nresearch journey. The incorporation
      of insights from the sociology of\\nscience and science and technology studies
      (STS) offered a refreshing\\nlens, challenging us to move beyond mere numbers
      and delve into the\\nsocial and cultural contexts that shape scientific knowledge
      production.\\nExploring diverse information sources, beyond the confines of\\nestablished
      databases, promised a more nuanced understanding of\\nscientific impact, particularly
      in regions often marginalized by\\ntraditional bibliometric approaches.\\n\\nBut
      most importantly, the shared experiences and diverse perspectives of\\ncolleagues
      from across the globe truly resonated. The STI 2023\\nconference brought together
      Global North and South voices, bridging the\\ngap between established research
      powerhouses and emerging scientific\\necosystems. Through open dialogue and
      critical reflection, we began to\\ndismantle the monolithic assumptions that
      often underpin bibliometric\\nanalysis. We acknowledged the distinct dynamics
      of scientific production\\nin different regions and the varying priorities and
      challenges faced by\\nresearchers in high-income and low-middle-income countries.\\n\\nThis
      newfound awareness, I believe, is the key to unlocking the true\\npotential
      of bibliometrics. By embracing diversity, incorporating\\ncritical perspectives,
      and forging connections across borders, we can\\ntransform this field from a
      passive observer into an active agent for\\npositive change. We can use bibliometrics
      not to reinforce existing\\ninequalities but to guide us toward a more inclusive
      and equitable\\nscientific landscape, one where research serves the needs of
      all,\\nregardless of their geographic location or economic standing.\\n\\nIn
      bidding farewell to the [Scientometrics Summer\\nSchool](https://www.cwts.nl/education/cwts-course-program/cwts-scientometrics-summer-school-2023){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      the [STI 2023\\nConference](https://www.sti2023.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      I can\\\\'t help\\nbut see it as not just an end but a promising new beginning.
      Armed with\\nenriched perspectives, I embark on the next chapter of my bibliometric\\njourney,
      eager to implement the lessons learned in contributing to a\\nmore equitable
      and impactful scientific landscape.  \\n\\n[  \\nHeader and in-text\_image:

      Although very visible during the COVID-19 pandemic, science\\nalso plays a large

      shape the role of science in\\nsocietal debates? Do scientists and societal
      actors interpret scientific\\nresults differently? How are these interpretations
      used in arguments?\\nHow do scientists themselves engage in such societal debates?\\n\\nIn
      addition to science, misinformation also plays a large role in\\nsocietal debates.
      During COVID-19, this prompted the World Health\\nOrganisation (WHO) to speak
      of an\\n[infodemic](https://www.who.int/health-topics/infodemic){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nSome
      of the misinformation might be countered, for example, by\\nfact-checkers, such

      \\\"[Nieuwscheckers](https://nieuwscheckers.nl/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\\"\\nhere

      or \\\"[Stop,\\nThink, Check](https://www.bemediasmart.ie/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\\",
      to help\\nprevent the spread of misinformation. But how does science interact
      with\\nmisinformation?\\n\\n### Science and misinformation\\n\\nWe are excited
      to start a new project on [Understanding Misinformation\\nand Science in Societal
      Debates\\n(UnMiSSeD)](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects/unmissed){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nIn
      this project, we will study the interaction between misinformation\\nand science
      during the COVID-19 pandemic using both quantitative and\\nqualitative approaches.
      Our quantitative analyses will be limited to\\nTwitter (now X), based on more
      than a billion tweets posted during the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic, combined with information
      on millions of publications\\nand tweets about them. We will go beyond Twitter
      in our qualitative\\nanalyses to explore how discussions permeate the porous
      boundaries of\\nsocial media. We will collaborate with Fondazione Bruno Kessler
      (FBK),\\nlead by [Riccardo\\nGallotti](https://chub.fbk.eu/team#h.4rhone98mox8){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      and\\nUniversity of Geneva, lead by [Tommaso\\nVenturini](http://www.tommasoventurini.it/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      We are\\nhappy that this project is supported by the [European Media and\\nInformation\\nFund](https://gulbenkian.pt/emifund/projects/understanding-misinformation-and-science-in-societal-debates-unmissed/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\n###
      New perspective\\n\\nAt CWTS, we already have previous experience with studying
      [connections\\nbetween science and\\nsociety](https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.24427){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      also in\\nthe context of\\n[COVID-19](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/delineating-covid-19-and-coronavirus-research-an-analysis-of-the-cord-19-dataset){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nWe
      also studied how COVID-19 appeared in [a media\\noutlet](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/exploring-the-covid-19-discourse-in-the-conversation){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nMuch
      of our knowledge on science in social media is based on data from\\n[Altmetric](https://www.altmetric.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      and provides a\\ngood lens on which aspects of academic publications relate
      to being\\nmentioned on (social) media. Previous projects at CWTS departed from\\nscience
      and explored where science was mentioned, referenced and taken\\nup. However,
      this approach misses the broader contexts in which science\\nis mentioned. Societal
      debates are multifaceted processes [where\\nscientific mentions are couched
      in and interact with other ways of\\nknowing the world](http://modesofexistence.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      In\\nthe UnMiSSeD project, our starting point are societal debates\\nthemselves.
      We explore when and how science becomes part of such\\ndebates, also in relation
      to misinformation and claims unrelated to\\nscience. In this way, we hope to
      better understand the role of science\\nand misinformation in societal debates.\\n\\nThis
      project brings together a novel combination of scientific fields at\\nCWTS.
      Traditionally, our centre is more focused on science (and\\ntechnology) studies.
      The UnMiSSeD project brings in not only\\ncomputational social sciences but
      also media and communication studies\\nand has clear connections to science
      communication. We hope to build out\\nthese connections in the near future.

      is organized by Ismael Rafols and Louise Bezuidenhout. This open\\npanel critically
      examines the Open Science (OS) movement and the\\nenactment of its core values
      of equity, fairness, and inclusiveness. As\\nthe OS infrastructural landscape
      evolves, there is an underlying\\nassumption that these values will support
      the evolution of an equitable\\ndigital commons and, in consequence, equitable
      science. Nonetheless,\\nsimply assuming that these values are embedded in infrastructural
      design\\ncan be viewed as problematic. These open panels will critically engage\\nwith

      the start of this year to organise our activities. Here, we introduce\\nthe
      vision and roadmap of the Focal Area Engagement & Inclusion.\\n\\n### Our vision\\n\\nIn
      today\\\\'s rapidly changing world, fostering a collaborative, diverse\\nand
      inclusive science ecosystem that engages with society is of\\nparamount importance.
      As we navigate complex global challenges such as\\nclimate change, pandemics,
      and artificial intelligence, it becomes\\nevident that diverse perspectives,
      inclusive participation and public\\nengagement in scientific knowledge creation
      and communication are key to\\nunlocking science-based solutions for societal
      challenges. The Focal\\nArea Engagement & Inclusion *envisions studying and
      promoting diversity\\nand inclusivity in the science ecosystem and the engagement
      and\\ncommunication between science and society.*\\n\\nIn line with the three
      pillars of the CWTS knowledge agenda --\\n*understanding*, *intervening* and
      *practising* -- we developed an\\nambitious agenda for the study and promotion
      of diversity, inclusion,\\nengagement, communication and science-society interactions.
      Our work\\nwill not only contribute to research and teaching around these\\nquestions,
      but will also support policy developments and interventions,\\nand generate
      insights into how we can implement our findings at our own\\ncentre.\\n\\n###
      Representation & Inclusiveness {#representation-inclusiveness}\\n\\nWe believe
      diversity and inclusivity in the global science ecosystem is\\nimportant. By
      breaking down barriers to participation in science for\\nindividuals from a
      variety of backgrounds, cultures, and experiences, we\\nenrich the pool of knowledge,
      ideas, and approaches in research, which,\\nin turn, helps to address scientific
      and societal challenges more\\neffectively. Who gets to participate in science
      is not always\\nself-evident and requires more fundamental understanding and\\nwell-considered
      interventions to improve the inclusion and\\nrepresentation of all social groups
      in science, and the science system\\nas a whole.\\n\\n### Epistemic Diversity\\n\\nEpistemic
      diversity in the science system is of major importance. We\\nneed to recognise
      how different topics, research questions, knowledge\\nsystems, and actors, including\\n[other-than-human](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23299460.2021.1906040){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nones,
      help to produce a fairer and more nuanced understanding of complex\\nglobal
      issues. By monitoring and promoting epistemic diversity, we\\nexpect to foster
      a more inclusive and innovative environment where\\ndifferent ways of knowing
      are valued and incorporated.\\n\\nFor instance, we want to study and address
      the lack of\\n[coverage](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-coverage-matters-invisibility-of-agricultural-research-from-the-global-south-may-be-an-obstacle-to-development){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      mainstream scientometric databases; a problem that stands in the way\\nof making
      important societal topics visible in science policy.\\nConsequently, we expect
      to develop\\n[*multiversatories*](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\npolicies,
      and recommendations to support funders and science policy with\\nreinforcing
      epistemic diversity.\\n\\n### Engagement & Communication {#engagement-communication}\\n\\nA
      research system that is disconnected from society is essentially\\nineffective.
      Science communication, public engagement with science, and\\nparticipatory approaches
      for collaborative knowledge production are\\nintegral building blocks for a
      stronger and more relevant research and\\ninnovation ecosystem. Effective science
      communication and public\\nengagement help to bridge the gap between academia
      and society; help to\\nmake scientific approaches and knowledge more accessible
      to the wider\\npublic and societal stakeholders (e.g. policy makers, industry,
      etc.);\\nlimit the impact of misinformation and the misuse of scientific\\ninformation;
      and may help to increase public trust in science. We will\\nstudy how society
      engages with science, in order to improve science\\ncommunication and strengthen
      the role science can play in society.\\n\\n[Citizen\\nscience](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/dossiers/academia-in-motion/open-science/citizen-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      other participatory approaches can create a stronger sense of\\nsocietal ownership
      and accountability, turning scientific research into\\na collective societal
      endeavour. Societal actors outside academia\\ncontribute to the scientific ecosystem
      in various ways, for instance\\nwith local and traditional knowledge or insights
      from lived experience,\\nor by contributing to evidence-informed policy-making.
      The engagement of\\nsocietal actors can also direct the attention of research
      to issues of\\nsocietal importance, increasing both their societal relevance
      and their\\npractical impacts. Engaging other actors, such as industry,\\npolicy-makers
      or non-governmental organisations, can help with more\\ninformed policy, decision-making
      and innovation. We want to study\\ncitizen-science practices and how they are
      changing scientific outcomes,\\nwith the aim of helping to shape citizen-science
      further.\\n\\n### Accomplishing our ambitions\\n\\n####   {#section dir=\\\"ltr\\\"}\\n\\n####

      The roadmap {#the-roadmap dir=\\\"ltr\\\"}\\n\\nWe have created a working group
      for each of the three sub-areas to\\nbundle expertise and resources. The working
      groups will bring together a\\ndiverse range of colleagues, from within and
      outside of CWTS, each\\ncontributing with their unique knowledge to tackle the
      complex\\nchallenges of the sub-areas.\\n\\nProjects play a pivotal role in
      our day-to-day work at CWTS. Our Focal\\nArea will help coordinate existing
      projects, and monitor funding\\nopportunities to set up new projects. Our focused
      strategy of aligning\\nprojects with the goals of the Focal Area will be crucial
      for achieving\\nour vision and ambitions.\\n\\nIn addition, engagement and communication
      activities will be of central\\nimportance for the Focal Area. We think of [dedicated\\nseminars](https://www.cwts.nl/seminars/diversity-and-inclusion-in-global-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nspecial
      sessions at conferences (e.g. a special session on \\\"[Researching\\n(in-)
      equity, diversity and inclusion in science through bibliometric,\\nmixed- and
      multi-method\\nstudie](https://www.sti2023.org/timetable/event/session-47/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}s\\\"\\norganised
      at the [STI 2023\\nconference](https://www.sti2023.org/program/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}),
      or\\nco-creation workshops with citizens and societal stakeholders. In line\\nwith
      our ideal of [practising what we\\npreach](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-knowledge-agenda-2023-2028){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nwe
      ourselves will communicate our work and activities to broader\\naudiences through
      blog posts and social media, and look forward to open\\nand engaging conversations
      with others on these topics.\\n\\nIf you are interested in partnering with us

      Open access: a change in publishing with a limited reach\\n\\nOpen Access is
      a movement and policy directive dedicated to reforming\\nthe closed or subscription-based
      gatekeeping of scientific research. In\\nthe subscription-based\_(when readers
      pay) model scientists communicate\\nthe results of their research, by submitting
      it to publishers, and in\\nmany cases to one of a small number of large commercial
      publishers,\\nconsidered to be [an\\noligopoly](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127502){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nPublishers
      \\\\'process\\\\' this work, then provide academic institutions\\n(i.e., libraries)
      with an \\\\'opportunity\\\\' to buy back research via\\njournal subscriptions.
      This is neither sound economically, nor is it\\nconducive to the growth of scientific
      knowledge. Open Access has\\ntherefore become a critically assessed and well-researched
      subject,\\nfocused on alternative approaches to publishing - i.e., green, gold,
      and\\nhybrid journal publishing, and Article Processing Fees (APCs) paid by\\ninstitutions
      or scholars themselves (author pays model). As a global\\nproject there is ample
      evidence that Open Access has a [limited\\nreach](https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/97555){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\n###
      Journal citation indexing and ranking (Assessment)\\n\\nDr. Eugene Garfield
      is a renowned figure in certain scientific\\ncommunities for having founded
      the [Institute for Scientific Information\\n(ISI)](https://clarivate.com/the-institute-for-scientific-information/history-of-isi/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nand
      for his [innovation in automated journal citation indexing - the\\nfirst *Science
      Citation\\nIndex*](http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/science1955.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nDr.
      Garfield lived a long and successful life (until the age of 91!);\\nlong enough
      to see his *Science Citation Index* grow to be one of the\\nmost useful reference
      tools for scholars and scientometricians\\nworldwide. Today, this index has
      been expanded commercially to include\\nadditional products, which are now part
      of Clarivate\\\\'s trademarked *Web\\nof Science\u2122*.\\n\\nDr. Garfield\\\\'s
      vision was not only to trace the history of ideas, but\\ndevelop a tool to assist
      university/college libraries with their journal\\nselection needs: a one-time
      legitimate process that had already been on\\nthe minds of other scientists.
      [Gross and Gross\\n(1927)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1651803){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      are\\ncredited by Garfield for being the first to ask: \\\\\\\"*What files of\\nscientific
      periodicals are needed in a college library to prepare the\\nstudent for advanced
      work\\\\... ?*\\\\\\\". The answer was to \\\\\\\"*compile a\\njournal list\\\"*
      considered to be \\\\\\\"*indispensable*\\\\\\\", and to base this\\nlist on
      an *\\\\\\\"arbitrary standard of some kind by which to determine the\\ndesirability
      of purchasing a particular journal\\\\\\\"* (p. 1713). That\\narbitrary standard
      was to focus on their citedness. Years later,\\n[Brodman\\n(1944)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC194405/pdf/mlab00266-0074.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nbecame
      a critic of [Gross and Gross\\\\'s\\n(1922](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1651803){target=\\\"_blank\\\"})\\nquantitative
      method, then shortly after, [Fussler\\n(1949)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4303733){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      took up\\nthe task again of listing leading journals. However, it was Dr.\\nGarfield,
      along with his innovation in electronic indexing, who\\nintroduced the [Journal
      Impact Factor\\n(JIF](http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/V1p527y1962-73.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\n\\nFor
      a long time, *the Science Citation Index* had a positive impact.\\nAlthough
      Garfield both witnessed and warned against the misuse of the\\nJIF when evaluating
      individuals, he is 'blissfully' unaware of the scale\\nof problems resulting
      from the [use of the Journal Impact\\nFactor](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-007-2036-x){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nNow,
      we are looking down a long dark hallway leading to what some might\\ncall\\n\\\\'[grimpact](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2019/05/28/grimpact-time-to-acknowledge-the-dark-side-of-the-impact-agenda/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\\\'.\\nIf
      we exit this dark hallway, we veer into a lit room called \\\\'Open\\nAccess\\\\',
      but, how does this relate to research assessment, and when did\\nwe get here?
      To answer this, we can go further back in history, when\\nscience first handed
      itself over to the profitable business of scholarly\\npublishing.\\n\\n### The
      growth of commercial publishing and journals (Access)\\n\\nWhen scientific letters,
      reports, and later periodicals first appeared\\n(i.e., the [*Philosophical Transactions
      of the Royal\\nSociety*](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/information-culture/the-mostly-true-origins-of-the-scientific-journal/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"})\\nthere
      were good reasons to outsource publishing to fledgling businesses.\\nEarly editors,
      like Henry Oldenburg (i.e., founding editor of the\\n*Philosophical Transactions*),
      were keen to generate income, but soon\\nrecognized how difficult it was to
      process, print, collect subscription\\nfees and manage society publications
      without accruing financial losses.\\nCommercial publishing grew at one time
      from a legitimate and realistic\\nneed. Editors required the support, and were
      for the most part, relieved\\nto hand over the work. In the beginning scientific
      publishing was not\\nprofitable, but gradually it became more so. New businesses
      were\\nfounded, and for the past three and half centuries we have seen journals\\ngrow
      at an [exponential\\nrate,](https://doi.org/10.1533/9781780634647.159){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\namounting
      to more than\\n[30,000](https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20180905095203579){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nthough
      according to [recent\\nestimates](https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/doi/10.1162/qss_a_00228/114119/Recalibrating-the-Scope-of-Scholarly-Publishing-A){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nthis
      number falls woefully short.\\n\\n### Digital publishing and pay models (Affordability)\\n\\nWe
      have now moved further and further away from this print-based\\nhistory, having
      stepped firmly into the digital age. Digital publishing\\nis less costly, and
      affords a significantly broader reach. However, the\\ncommercial subscription
      model paired with the ISI-Citation Index and\\nelite selection of journals (based
      on the JIF) contributes not only to\\nthe evaluation problem, but the access
      problem as well.\\n\\nWith the legacy of print maintained, Open Access is transitioning\\ntowards
      a 'flipped' publishing economy solution, with an increasing\\nmarket concentration
      of academic publishers. This development is pushed\\nby science policy and transformative
      agreements, but also by the\\nacquisitions of Open Access publishers. Consumption-side
      business models\\nare slowly being replaced by supply-side-business models,
      but we cannot\\nassume that [there will always be enough money in the academic\\nsystem](https://doi.org/10.1002/leap.1219){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      Some\\nscholars can benefit from [Plan\\nS](https://www.coalition-s.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      which allows them to\\nrely on public research funding to make research results
      immediately\\naccessible, but such affordability is not available to all. Research\\nshows
      that when scholars intend to submit a new manuscript for\\npublication, [consideration
      is still given to the prestige attached to a\\nhighly-ranked\\njournal](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20191574){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nEmpirical
      studies in the field of biomedicine have also shown how\\n[knowledge production
      is consolidated around the\\nJIF.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11024-015-9274-5){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nMany
      journals are simply privileged with a high rank, because of a\\n[strong age\\nbias](https://doi.org/10.5465/amle.2009.37012185){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      And,\\nin the age of AI, new empirical research has found that a [journal's\\nimpact
      factor is a bad predictor for 'thoroughness' and 'helpfulness' of\\nreviews.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02787-5){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_\\n\\nThus,
      it seems more important than ever to ask ourselves how we can\\ncontinue with
      Open Access, when the technology behind indexing, and the\\njournal reputation
      economy has added to continued problems.  \\n\\n### Open Access Ideology  {#open-access-ideology}\\n\\nMost
      academics are keen to support Open Access. Some are even Open\\nAccess ideologists.
      Certain ideologists may be refusing to publish\\ncontent in any journal which
      is currently not freely available and fully\\naccessible. Some might even refuse
      to carry out peer review for\\npublishers that they do not respect *(note: Why
      should I volunteer my\\ntime and efforts to support a greedy industry?)*\\n\\nAn
      approach like this, with all good intentions, has a downside. Though\\nit is
      meant to put pressure on the commercial publishing industry, it is\\nsocially
      and scientifically unaffordable for many members of our broader\\nscientific
      community, especially [at a time when peer review is in\\ncrisis](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2022/06/13/peer-review-crisis-creates-problems-journals-and-scholars){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nScholars
      are responsible for peer review, yet find it difficult amidst\\nthis tension
      between open access and paywalled content. The last thing\\nthat we need is
      fewer reviewers to call upon, or at least one less in\\nsituations where certain
      researchers have little choice but to publish\\nin one of the commercially indexed,
      paywalled journals.\\n\\nPerhaps support for Open Access no longer demands that
      we focus *solely*\\non current ideologies attributed to this mandate. Is it
      not time to exit\\nthe well-lit OA-room and trip down that long dark hallway
      again, towards\\na radically new, and disruptive socio-technical innovation?\\n\\n###
      Socio-Technical Innovation\\n\\nThe creation of a systemic change, or shift
      in perceptions and behaviour\\npatterns within our global scientific community
      implies that [innovation\\nstarts with some sort of 'symbolic\\nstrategy'](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/how-to-change-the-world-9780195334760?cc=dk&lang=en&){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nA
      strategy, which encourages scholars and institutions worldwide, to\\nrelinquish
      the symbolic nature of journal rank and prestige, especially\\nin evaluation
      systems.\\n\\nDr. Garfield was a socio-technical innovator for his time. He
      took us\\nfrom the print age into the electronic age. We have also been introduced\\nto
      the semantic Web, and now we are at the development stages of Web\\n5.0 - the
      open, linked, and intelligent Web. Let us not forget that [Tim\\nBerners-Lee's
      idea behind the Web in the first place was to keep track\\nof scientific\\ninformation](https://home.web.cern.ch/science/computing/birth-web){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}!\\nIn
      addition to a symbolic shift within the scientific/scholarly\\ncommunication
      system we can move towards a material or tangible shift.\\n\\nImagine, therefore;
      a reputation economy in science/scholarship, which\\nis not attached to journal
      rank and title. What is a scientific journal,\\nif not its editor-in-chief,
      editorial board, and thousands of volunteer\\nacademics worldwide who peer review
      submitted manuscripts? Many, if not\\nmost scholars believe in preserving the
      journal, and we will likely find\\nit difficult to forget about them. Journals
      perform a constituent and\\norganising role; a tangible outlet for scientific
      fields and\\ndisciplines. But, if we open ourselves up to more radical solutions,
      we\\nmight rather focus on preserving the registering, curating, evaluating,\\ndisseminating,
      and archiving function of journals, whilst keeping in\\nmind that[*their real
      value* lies in the communities that they\\ncreate.](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2019/03/29/the-value-of-a-journal-is-the-community-it-creates-not-the-papers-it-publishes/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nEditors
      and editorial teams, for example, may choose to forgo journal\\n*titles* altogether
      and exit a commercial publisher (Note: [Exits do\\nhappen, as in the case of
      an editor and editorial board leaving a\\ncommercial publisher to form a new
      Open Access\\njournal](https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/1/1/1/15579/Opening-science-The-rebirth-of-a-scholarly-journal?searchresult=1){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\nIn
      Shakespearian terms, what is in a name if 'by any other name' the\\nrose would
      'smell as sweet!' (i.e., journal name is different, but the\\neditorial community
      is the same, and scholars continue to respect that\\neditorial community)? In
      a similar vein, editorial boards might be\\nencouraged to leave a commercial
      publisher, and move to an Open Access\\nInternational Scholarship Space: A space
      [focused on managing and\\nmaintaining digitally transformed scholarly\\nrecords](https://zenodo.org/record/6948200#.ZD_Pyy9Byjh){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nwhich
      fulfils the traditional functions of a journal, ready to adapt to\\nany future
      needs.\\n\\nImagine a solution where an editor and editorial team are assigned
      to a\\ntopic management center of their own creation (i.e., [a kind of digital\\nlibrary](https://doi.org/10.3390/publications11010007){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nor
      [scholarly digital\\ninfrastructure](https://zenodo.org/records/5564003){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\nAt
      each online center, there could be a description of the topic area,\\nincluding
      the specialty research areas of the editorial team. So, for\\nexample, if we
      renounce a commercially published journal called the\\n\\\"*Journal of the Information
      Age*\\\" and renounce the titled journal\\ncalled \\\"*Quantitative Studies
      of Quantitativeness*\\\", our international\\ncommunity would then think about
      putting an article up for review at the\\n\\\"A Topic-Editorial Team\\\" or
      the \\\"B Topic-Editorial Team\\\".\\n\\nWhatever solution we choose, it starts
      with abandoning journal titles\\nand rank then shifting to an innovative international\\nsocio-technological
      platform, based on key journal functions. The result\\nwould still be accessible
      research, still peer reviewed, and valued\\naccording to what should be valued:
      editorial teams and engaged peer\\nreview.\\n\\nThis solution may be realised
      in many different shapes or forms, and may\\nnot necessarily solve all problems.
      We are not aiming to be strictly\\nprescriptive here. However, it would put
      the scholarly record keeping\\nfirmly back into our own hands, and not in the
      hands of commercial\\nownership, though any kind of solution can include some
      commercial\\nservice providers (e.g., technical expertise, administrative support;\\nstyle-setting/XML).
      It would also enable us to give more attention to\\nother issues, like [challenges
      associated with peer\\nreview](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-00403-8){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nTaking
      such steps would be difficult, but we believe that the\\ninternational science
      community is ready, and that there is more to gain\\nthrough technological innovation.\\n\\n

      environmental, social and economic challenges in\\ntheir\_[Recommendation on
      Open\\nScience](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949/PDF/379949eng.pdf.multi){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThe
      text seems to be bearing considerable hope for fostering science\\npractices
      that are open, transparent, collaborative and inclusive by\\nvaluing quality
      and integrity, collective benefits, equity and fairness,\\nand diversity and
      inclusiveness as core values.\\n\\nAlso, the European Commission embraced open
      science as a policy priority\\nwith considerable investment in the development
      of the 'European Open\\nScience Cloud' as a central platform to publish, find
      and reuse research\\nassets. Simultaneously, European funding prioritises open
      science\\npractices in the form of sharing of publications and data 'as open
      as\\npossible and as closed as necessary'.\\n\\nIndeed it seems that these policy
      investments do carry fruits as can be\\nseen in the formation of national bodies,
      like\_[Open Science\\nNetherlands](https://www.openscience.nl/en){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      that were\\nheralded as supporting the advancement of open science on country-level\\nor
      the evident\_[inclusion of open science in university\\nstrategies](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/strategic-plan-2025.){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nNonetheless,
      open science is also a\_terribly ambiguous\_['umbrella\\nterm'](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-00026-8_2){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_that\\nis
      enacted in multiple ways across different research communities.\\nConceptions
      range from purely output-oriented notions surrounding open\\naccess to process-oriented
      priorities, such as engaging non-academics in\\nknowledge production. As my
      colleagues Ismael Rafols and Ingeborg Meijer\\nsummarise in their blogpost on\_[monitoring
      open\\nscience](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/08/14/the-benefits-of-open-science-are-not-inevitable-monitoring-its-development-should-be-value-led){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}:
      \ \\n\\nWhen relating this ambiguity to research(er) assessment, it becomes\\nevident
      that the proliferation of open science practices challenges the\\nmonochromatic
      properties of publication-driven research(er) assessments.\\nThis urges research
      assessment to be reconsidered in the light of open\\nscience. Luckily, there
      has been much work in making research(er)\\nassessment more polychromatic. This
      has been spearheaded by initiatives\\nsuch as [DORA](https://sfdora.org/about-dora/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      has\\nstabilised with the formulation of the [Hong Kong\\nPrinciples](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000737){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      recently has institutionalised in the [Coalition for Advancing\\nResearch Assessment](https://coara.eu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      (COARA); a\\nmassive undertaking that supports the adoption of responsible research\\nassessment
      practices across knowledge producing organisations. Indeed,\\nCoARA's description
      on their webpage summarises briefly what responsible\\nresearch assessment means
      for them:\\n\\nSimilarly to open science, [responsible research assessment describes
      a\\nbroad range of\\naspirations](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/navigating-responsible-research-assessment-guidelines#:~:text=RRA%20%22is%20an%20umbrella%20term,diverse%20and%20inclusive%20research%20cultures.%22){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      research assessment that largely focus on the responsible use of\\nresearch
      metrics in assessment contexts and the fostering of an\\ninclusive and diverse
      research culture in science through assessment.\\nThese developments in research
      assessment recognise and promote\\npractices that paint a more polychromatic
      picture of science, where\\nresearch(ers) are recognised and rewarded for more
      than the outputs they\\nproduce.\\n\\nBoth developments -- open science and
      responsible research assessment --\\nhave a unique opportunity to strengthen
      and reinforce one another.\\nResearch assessment reform can provide the institutional
      incentives to\\nthe adoption of open scientific practices in research, and the
      diversity\\nof practices promoted under open science can serve the reform of\\nresearch(er)
      assessment. However, despite this promising interrelation,\\nboth movements
      risk developing in parallel to one another as long as\\nquestions about the
      aspirations of open science are not discussed with\\nthe affordances of responsible
      research assessment in mind.\\n\\nIndeed, there is ongoing work to illuminate
      these complexities in the\\nform of various European Commission-funded projects.
      How research(er)\\nassessment that considers opens science can play out in practice
      is\\nbeing researched by [GraspOS](https://graspos.eu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      a\\nproject which is concerned with how infrastructures afford the uptake of\\nresearch
      assessment that values open science. The project\\n[OPUS](https://opusproject.eu/about/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      focuses on\\nindicators for the assessment of researchers in the context of
      open\\nscience. [PathOS](https://pathos-project.eu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      tries to\\nbetter understand the impacts of open science. Similarly, the [SUPER\\nMoRRI](https://super-morri.eu/transition-in-science/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nproject
      developed an [evaluation and monitoring\\nframework](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/a-monitoring-and-evaluation-framework-for-responsibility-in-r-i)\\nfor
      responsible research and innovation in Europe that, in many ways,\\nrelates
      to reconfigurations in knowledge production as posited under the\\nbanner of
      open science as well.\\n\\nEarly reflections from these projects and related
      communities can be\\nbrought forward with [Sabina Leonelli's recent book\\n(2023)](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009416368){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      She\\ndescribes open science as backed by a rationale that relies on a strong\\norientation
      towards the sharing of objects of science. These objects do\\nnot necessarily
      describe how research is done, but are themselves\\n(by)products of research,
      including data, publications, models, codes et\\ncetera. In this notion of science,
      *access* to existing scholarship and\\nrelated objects becomes conditional for
      successful open science.\\n\\nIndeed, this notion of open science is widely
      shared and is often\\nreinforced in research(er) assessments that consider open
      science\\nthrough the enrolment of object-oriented knowledge that comes in the\\nform
      of indicators describing e.g., open access outputs. However, these\\nresearch
      assessments only make visible a very narrow interpretation of\\nopenness in
      science and obscure descriptions of how research *is done*\\n-- which is a key
      consideration for recognising and rewarding\\nresearchers on responsible conduct
      of research, transdisciplinary work\\nand other 'broader' interpretations that
      can be found in the\\n[UNESCO](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949/PDF/379949eng.pdf.multi){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nconceptualisation
      of openness; and often remain invisible.\\n\\nThis gives rise to interesting
      questions about capturing immaterial\\nproperties of research, in particular
      when it comes to shared knowledge\\nproduction processes and how they reconfigure
      values and relations or\\nbring up matters of collective concern. These dimensions
      of research are\\nstill widely underrepresented and unaddressed in research(er)\\nassessments
      in the context of (open) science.\\n\\nConclusively, research(er) assessment
      that considers open science is\\nstill in a nascent stage. It is therefore critical
      to collate and\\nexchange experiences of practical attempts to conduct research\\nassessment
      that considers open science. At GraspOS, we will ask these\\nquestions in bimonthly
      online meetings starting 18 October 2023 and\\npresent ongoing stories from
      universities, national funders, thematic\\nresearch clusters to discuss the
      multiple ways in which (responsible)\\nresearch assessment considers open science.\\n\\nWe
      hope to hear stories about issues, frustrations and successes of\\nresearch
      assessment in relation to open science. Finally, the goal of\\nthis community
      is to create a bouquet of stories from which we can learn\\nand draw inspiration
      for our own research assessments. If this is\\nsomething of interest to you,

      the Leiden Ranking more transparent**\\n\\nBeing as transparent as possible
      is one of [our principles for\\nresponsible university\\nranking](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/responsibleuse){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nWhile
      the Leiden Ranking offers methodological transparency by\\n[documenting its\\nmethods](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/general){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      considerable detail, the [Web of Science\\ndata](https://clarivate.com/products/webofscience/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      on\\nwhich the ranking is based (made available to us by Clarivate, the owner\\nof
      Web of Science) is of a proprietary nature and cannot be shared\\nopenly. This
      limits the [transparency and\\nreproducibility](https://arma.ac.uk/rethinking-the-rankings/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nof
      the Leiden Ranking. It is also in tension with the growing\\nrecognition of
      the importance of \\\"independence and transparency of the\\ndata, infrastructure
      and criteria necessary for research assessment and\\nfor determining research
      impacts\\\" (one of the principles of the\\n[Agreement on Reforming Research\\nAssessment](https://coara.eu/app/uploads/2022/09/2022_07_19_rra_agreement_final.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\n\\nIn
      the [new strategic plan of\\nCWTS](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-focal-areas-of-cwts){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nopenness
      of research information is a top priority. Open data sources\\nsuch as [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      and\\n[OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} offer exciting\\nopportunities
      to produce bibliometric analytics in a fully transparent\\nand reproducible
      way. We are currently working on an ambitious project\\nin which we explore
      the use of open data sources to create a fully\\ntransparent and reproducible
      version of the Leiden Ranking. We expect to\\nshare the outcomes of this project
      later this year.\\n\\n### **Let us know your feedback and ideas**\\n\\nAs always,
      we appreciate your feedback on the Leiden Ranking and your\\nideas on ways to
      improve the ranking. Don't hesitate to [reach\\nout](https://www.leidenranking.com/contact){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}!\\n\\n

      global inequality, require critical interrogation\\nof the contributions and
      consequences of science. In the process of\\nunderstanding, resolving, and transforming
      global challenges we should\\nbe attentive to what is at the core of science:
      the attribution of value\\nto numerical or qualitative values such as counting,
      classifying and\\nevaluating physical and societal phenomena. This also holds
      for the\\npractice of governing science. Science policy articulates particular\\nkinds
      of future (e.g. environmental or societal outcomes) that are\\nconsidered either
      desirable or unattractive, and it ascribes particular\\nroles and values to
      science in the making of these futures. This raises\\nimportant questions about
      the values attributed to scientific expertise\\nand policy making in relation
      to sustainable futures, and the role and\\nagency of science and policy in shaping
      sustainable futures.\\n\\nIn an attempt to address these questions, we hosted
      [a two-day workshop\\non 13 and 14 June\\n2023](https://www.fluid-knowledge.com/workhop){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      as part\\nof the\\n[FluidKnowledge](https://www.fluid-knowledge.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nproject
      of Sarah de Rijcke. We gathered a variety of academics\\nreflecting on doing
      science in times of climate breakdown. Participants\\nsubmitted contributions
      that covered different topics including but not\\nlimited to biodiversity modelling
      for sustainable financing, sustainable\\nagriculture, deep sea mining and nature
      conservation. The variety of\\ntopics provided different angles to reflect upon
      roles and practices at\\nthe interface between science policy and scientific
      expertise, and how\\nscientists position themselves in their research. Although
      many relevant\\nconcepts were discussed for each contribution, we would like
      here to\\nhighlight two common themes: Power and Plurality. Both concepts\\nmaterialized
      in various forms and contexts and made the bridge between\\nthe different contributions.
      The combination of Power and Plurality made\\nus, during the workshop, reflect
      upon our own position as researchers.  \\n\\n### Power, Plurality, and the Position
      of the research(er)\\n\\nWe started the workshop with two contributions addressing
      climate and\\nbiodiversity modelling. Power materializes in modelling practices
      when\\nmodellers navigate the powerfulness of climate and biodiversity scenario\\nmodels
      in shaping policies and futures. Biodiversity and climate models\\nare often
      developed by scientific institutions to project biodiversity\\nand climate patterns.
      However, their power extends beyond the scientific\\ninstitutions when they
      are applied to, for example, inform\\ndecision-making in sustainable financing
      or global policy-making. In\\nthese translation processes from science to environmental\\ndecision-making
      the political, social and ethical dimensions come into\\nplay. The plurality
      of perspectives present in these dimensions are\\n*not* integrated in the original
      models. Nevertheless, the models and\\nthe knowledge models create *are* used
      in high level decision-making and\\nserve therefore as a powerful tool that
      scientific institutions should\\ntake into account in their model designs.\\n\\nWhen
      zooming out, we touched upon the powerful organizational forms of\\nwhat is
      valued as 'useful science', which is now dominated by the\\n(Western) techno
      economic paradigms that steer green technology\\ntransitions. A good example
      of the power of this paradigm is the demands\\nit puts on governments, companies,
      and researchers to explore the deep\\nseabed for minerals like cobalt to support
      a sustainable future. We\\ntouched upon deep sea research that seem to be trapped
      into a power\\ngrab, controlled by (inter)national governments and industry
      to generate\\nknowledge on the environmental impacts of deep-sea mining useful
      for\\ncompanies and policy-making at international levels. In relation to\\nthat,
      the importance of disinterestedness of researchers in this space\\nis highly
      valued by most actors involved. As a result, this means that\\neyebrows are
      being raised when researchers cooperate with industry or,\\nalternatively, when
      researchers tend to take radical views against deep\\nsea mining. Is it, as
      scientists, justifiable to step away from the\\nimportance of being detached
      and disinterested, and actively choose\\nsides?\\n\\n### Whose side are we on?\\n\\n'Whose
      side are we on' as researchers was vividly highlighted when\\ndiscussing a contribution
      on the co-creation of knowledge for nature\\nconservation in South Africa. The
      pressure put on scientists to engage\\nwith the variety of social actors that
      work in South African nature\\nparks stems from the belief that this would increase
      the effectiveness\\nof implementing conservation policies and empower local
      communities.\\nHowever, based on experiences with research projects on transfrontier\\nwildlife
      management and private game farming, we discussed whether\\nknowledge co-creation
      can also be counterproductive for empowering\\nmarginalized communities. This
      could be the case when powerful actors\\nlike non-profit organizations or wildlife
      managers try to silence\\nmarginalized communities through discrediting researchers
      and\\ndelegitimizing other types of knowledges and perspectives. Instead of\\ndisengaging,
      detaching, and staying independent from these power\\ndynamics, researchers
      might have to choose positions when engaging in\\nthese types of socio-ecological
      issues.\\n\\nBy the end of a fruitful and constructive workshop discussion,
      we were\\nleft with more questions than answers to reflect upon. The discussions\\nand
      diversity of topics that were addressed in the context of doing\\nscience in
      times of climate breakdown led us to reflect on who's side we\\nare on as researchers
      ourselves. This includes the question of what we\\ncan potentially do (more
      of) or should stop doing within our research\\nand beyond to address global
      challenges. What does it actually mean to\\nbe a scientist in this world? Should
      we politicize science, take (very)\\ncritical views on what is happening, stand
      up from the relatively\\ncomfortable science studies armchair and dive in?\\n\\nWhat
      is next? All workshop participants will continue to write their own\\ncontributions
      and reflect on these questions in the next year. The\\ncurrent contributions
      will be further developed into a journal\\ncollection or edited volume. We extend
      our warm thanks to all\\nparticipants of the workshop: B\xE9atrice Cointe, Klaudia

      and\\nScholarship*](https://www.cwts.nl/download/f-x2q2x2.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nthat
      we have been working on between 2017 and 2022.  \\n\\n### Not another research
      program\\n\\nWhilst it is common for research institutes at Dutch universities
      to\\nhave a *research program*, over the past years we began to feel the\\nlimits
      of a framing that prioritizes research and leaves less room for\\nother important
      activities. Instead, we wanted our new strategy to\\nembrace all our activities,
      from our fundamental research to our tool\\ndevelopment, and from our interventions
      in policy and education to our\\nconsultancy and contract work. The term *knowledge
      agenda* is intended\\nto communicate this inclusive ambition. It describes the
      mission we will\\nwork on, the collective values we will uphold, and the strategic
      topics\\nwe will address.  \\n\\n### Mission\\n\\nIn the lead-up to this new
      knowledge agenda, we spent a considerable\\namount of time in 2022 discussing
      with the entire CWTS team the mission\\nand values of our centre. We also organized
      two retreats that included\\nbrainstorming sessions with academic partners and
      other stakeholders and\\neven offered an opportunity to [develop dream\\nprojects](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/dreaming-at-cwts).
      And\\nfinally, we worked on defining focal areas for our institute and\\ndeveloped
      a new organizational structure around these focal areas. We\\nwill introduce
      these focal areas in a [next blog\\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-focal-areas-of-cwts).\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/20230509-knowledge-agenda.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"33918\\\"
      alt=\\\"Knowledge agenda\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\n  \\nTogether, we came up with
      the following mission statement for our\\ncentre:\\n\\n*Our mission at CWTS
      is to improve how science is practiced and governed\\nand how it serves society*\\n\\nTo
      realize this mission, we aim to develop a deep understanding of the\\ndynamics
      of scientific knowledge production, based on in-depth\\nengagement with a broad
      range of scientific and societal stakeholders.\\nWe also aim to contribute to
      reforms in research assessment, adoption of\\nopen science practices, changes
      in research cultures, and innovations in\\nresearch analytics. Moreover, recognizing
      that we are part of the\\nresearch system ourselves, we strive to practice what
      we preach and to\\nlead by example.  \\n\\n### Values\\n\\nIn our new knowledge
      agenda, we are trying to adopt a [more explicitly\\nvalue-led\\nframework](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/responsible-research-culture-practicing-what-we-preach-at-cwts)\\nthat
      aims for congruence between the knowledge we create, our own\\nresearch culture,
      and our internal governance mechanisms. The goal of\\n'practicing what we preach'
      is to foster a positive culture at our\\ncentre, not only stemming from our
      knowledge about the research system,\\nbut also born from and carried by the
      CWTS community. To incorporate a\\nmore active reflection on our own values
      into our strategy, we\\ncollectively developed four core values to guide our
      work and\\ndecision-making:  \\n\\n- *Transformative.* We want to make a difference
      by inciting\\n  transformative changes in the way science is practiced and governed\\n
      \ and the way it serves society.\\n\\n- *Evidence-informed.* We value evidence-informed
      work and\\n  policy-making. We collect scientific evidence and act on it, but
      we\\n  also acknowledge its limitations. Scientific evidence offers essential\\n
      \ insights for improving how science is practiced and governed, but\\n  these
      insights are always tentative and dependent on context.\\n\\n- *Collaborative.*
      We value collaborative work. To address the complex\\n  challenges faced by
      science and society, we prefer to collaborate\\n  rather than compete, both
      internally within our team and with external\\n  stakeholders. We cherish a
      diversity of perspectives and strive for a\\n  balanced representation and recognition
      of everyone's interests and\\n  contributions.\\n\\n- *Responsible.* We promote
      more responsible ways of practicing and\\n  governing science, for instance
      by making research processes more\\n  inclusive, research evaluations more fair,
      and research analytics more\\n  transparent. We practice what we preach by making
      our own way of\\n  working more responsible.\\n\\n### The coming years\\n\\nThe
      CWTS knowledge agenda 2023-2028 is intended to be an encompassing,\\nhigh-level,
      and value-led strategic plan. It is meant to focus our\\nefforts at a time when
      pushes for reform in research assessment and the\\nincreased need for openness
      in research practices provide us with a\\nunique opportunity to contribute to
      a stronger and healthier research\\nsystem. Among other things, we plan to consider
      how research evaluation\\nin its many forms conditions research agendas, notions
      of quality, and\\ndaily practices of research and scholarly communication; how
      strategic\\nand meaningful public engagement can become integral to realizing
      the\\nvalue and relevance of academic research; how policy recommendations for\\nmore
      inclusive and diverse academic careers can be developed; and how\\nstructural
      inequities and lack of diversity and inclusion in global\\nscience can be better
      understood and addressed. Tackling these and other\\nquestions requires joint
      action by many different stakeholders in the\\nresearch system. With our new
      knowledge agenda, we hope to meaningfully\\ncontribute to this in the years
      to come.  \\n\",\"published_at\":1683621900,\"updated_at\":1737279956,\"registered_at\":0,\"indexed_at\":1731078596,\"authors\":[{\"name\":

      How agriculture benefits from research through extension and engagement\\n\\nDifferent
      sectors benefit from science in different ways. In the case of\\nagriculture,
      [innovations based on science often originate from\\nproviders](https://doi.org/10.1016/0048-7333(84)90018-0){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nof
      farmers, for example in the form of seeds or machinery. However, the\\ndiffusion
      or uptake of innovations is difficult, in particular for small\\nfarmers. For
      this reason, the dissemination of agricultural research\\nthrough initiatives
      like 'extension' programs has long been recognized\\nas essential for development.\\n\\nThese
      extension activities to reach out to small farmers are\\nparticularly important
      in relation to improving livelihoods. In 2020,\\n[720-811 million were suffering
      from\\nhunger](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nworldwide,
      of which 50% were estimated to be small farmers. This means\\nthat improving
      food security requires forms of research transfer and\\nlocal and indigenous
      knowledge integration that reach out to small\\nfarmers, who constitute a particularly
      vulnerable group.\\n\\nPublic organisations working on agriculture have long
      been aware of the\\ncentrality of 'extension' for improving rural livelihoods.
      The reason is\\nthat agriculture depends heavily on contexts, and agricultural
      contexts\\nmay change dramatically across short geographical distances due to\\nvariations
      in climate and soils. The notion of 'extension' research\\ngradually shifted
      from top-down, unidirectional teaching from\\nresearchers to farmers, toward
      more mutual learning and co-operation\\nbetween researchers and farmers, so
      that science can respond to these\\nlocal needs and contexts. Through [participatory
      and learning\\napproaches](https://www.participatorymethods.org/page/about-participatory-methods){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\ncan
      technical and local knowledge be combined in order to achieve\\nappropriate
      technologies.\\n\\n### The lower visibility of engaged scholarship in agriculture
      may lead to use of inappropriate technology\\n\\nHowever, research that is more
      engaged with users and more orientated\\ntowards application tends to be associated
      with lower academic\\nvisibility, because its publications are often not included
      in the\\nmainstream bibliographic databases.\\n\\n[Various\\nstudies](https://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/66409/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nhave
      shown that coverage of journals of agricultural sciences in\\nmainstream databases
      is lower than in the natural sciences, but well\\nabove the social sciences
      and the humanities. Yet the situation is much\\nworse in terms of the coverage
      of the Global South in the mainstream\\ndatabases. For example, [studies by
      Subbiah\\nArunachalam](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/24106511.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      2001 showed that of the 10,000 publications by Indian researchers in\\nagricultural
      research, 78% were in Indian journals and 77% were not\\nindexed by Web of Science.
      Other studies have highlighted that crops\\nrelevant in the Global South also
      have a much lower coverage in Web of\\nScience (WoS), for example [the crop
      pearl\\nmillet](http://oar.icrisat.org/7945/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\n[A
      study on rice\\nresearch](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3kf9d/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nfound
      that coverage of publications in mainstream databases was 2 to\\n3-fold higher
      for the Global North. Similarly, the coverage of topics\\nrelevant to the Global
      North in WoS and Scopus was 2-3-fold higher than\\nthe topics more relevant
      in the Global South -- as illustrated in Figure\\n1 for the case of rice research.\\n\\nGiven
      that the mission of agricultural research institutes and councils\\nis to increase
      food security, reduce poverty and improve natural\\necosystems, knowledge communicated
      through a plurality of channels\\nshould be valued beyond mainstream international
      journals. This would\\ninclude, for example, publication formats such as those
      collected by FAO\\nin its [AGRIS database](https://agris.fao.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      (based\\non national collection and analysis centres), which include coverage
      of\\nmore diverse document types (reports, policy briefs, etc.) in comparison\\nto
      citation index databases such as WoS or to abstracting and indexing\\ndatabases
      such as CAB Abstracts.\\n\\nThis lack of visibility has at least two downsides.
      First, universities\\nor research institutes conducting extension programmes
      or engaged\\nagricultural research have often come to be perceived as not doing\\nprestigious
      science -- as excellence has increasingly been defined\\naccording to publications
      in prestigious journals. As a result,\\nresearchers may feel motivated to study
      topics valued by 'top' journals,\\nwhich are mostly focused on topics in the
      Global North.\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"image-full landscape\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Rafols_Figure1.png\\\"

      mainstream databases, Scopus and Web of Science (WoS), and a\\ndatabase with
      a larger coverage of the Global South, CAB Abstracts\\n(2003-12). Topics which
      are more relevant for the Global North (such as\\nmolecular biology) have a
      much higher coverage than topics relevant to\\nsmall farmers in the Global South
      (such as plant characteristics or\\nprotection). <a href=\\\"https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3kf9d/\\\"\\ntarget=\\\"_blank\\\">Source:

      without being indexed in databases and without good Academic\\nSearch Engine
      Optimization for Open Access content, valuable contextual\\nknowledge is harder
      to discover, making it challenging to retrieve or\\naccess it. In consequence,
      technical experts in agriculture in the\\nGlobal South are more likely to apply
      technologies which are\\ninappropriate in their countries. For instance, the
      crop varieties that\\nare available in WoS may not correspond to relevant varieties
      for a\\ntropical context, and information about the crops may be appropriate
      for\\nEurope but inappropriate in Brazil or India. Including more local\\nagricultural
      journals in bibliographic databases could help promote\\nlocal agricultural
      solutions, as researchers and practitioners would\\nhave access to a wider range
      of information and perspectives.\\n\\n[A recent\\nstudy](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3886019){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nshows
      that countries in Africa and Asia suffer a much higher loss of\\nproductivity
      in agriculture than countries in Europe and the Americas as\\na consequence
      of the use of inappropriate technologies, where the degree\\nof inappropriateness
      is estimated as the mismatch in the presence of\\ncrop-specific pests and pathogens
      (see Figure 2). This inappropriate use\\nof agricultural technologies is partly
      due to the lower amount of\\nresearch in topics and areas of interest of the
      Global South, but also\\npartly due to the challenges in locating and accessing
      contextualised\\nknowledge which already exists but is published in local venues\\n(journals,
      reports, policy documents, etc.).\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"image-full landscape\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Rafols_Figure2.png\\\"

      coverage of agriculture in bibliographic databases\\n\\nA [new\\npublication](https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/doi/10.1162/qss_a_00228/114119/Recalibrating-the-Scope-of-Scholarly-Publishing-A){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nby
      the [Public Knowledge Project](https://pkp.sfu.ca/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\ninterestingly
      challenges the perception, created by the conventional use\\nof mainstream databases,
      that research is extremely concentrated in\\njournals and publications of the
      Global North. Analysing 25,671 journals\\nwith 5.8 million documents of the
      platform Open Journal System (OJS),\\nthey found that 80% of the publications
      originated in the Global South,\\nthat 85% are in diamond Open Access (no fee
      for authors nor readers) and\\nalmost half of them have more than one language.\\n\\nThe
      success of the OJS infrastructure in making possible access and\\nvisibility
      of knowledge from the Global South suggests that it is high\\ntime for the development
      of more comprehensive databases. This has been\\na concern in medical research
      and social science and humanities (SSH),\\nleading to the development of regional
      specialised databases such as\\n[Scielo](https://scielo.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      (more on health) and\\n[Redalyc](https://www.redalyc.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      (more on SSH). In\\nrecent years we have also witnessed the development of more\\ncomprehensive
      databases like [Open\\nAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\n[Dimensions](https://www.dimensions.ai/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      or\\n[Lens](https://www.lens.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nWe have conducted
      a small study using the [MIAR portal of the\\n'Information Matrix for the Analysis
      of\\nJournals'](https://miar.ub.edu/idioma/en){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} of the\\nUniversity
      of Barcelona in order to make a rough estimate of the journal\\ncoverage of
      various databases (see detailed\\n[methodology](https://osf.io/fd9cv){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      and [journal\\ndata](https://osf.io/9hdgc){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}). As shown
      in Figure 3,\\nfrom a sample of 1662 journals from any country with ISSN related
      to\\nagriculture, we found that CAB Abstracts had the highest coverage with\\n805
      (48%) journals, 562 (34%) of Scopus, 435 (26%) of WoS and 550 (33%)\\nof Veterinary
      Sciences. In terms of regional coverage, CAB Abstracts and\\nVeterinary Sciences
      have a better and broader coverage in the Global\\nSouth in relative terms.\\n\\n<figure

      journals by the largest database specialised in\\nagriculture, CAB Abstracts,
      in comparison to WoS and Scopus. 46% of the\\njournals are not covered by any
      of these databases.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nThese results have to be contrasted
      with new databases such as\\n*Dimensions* and *Open Alex* that index papers
      rather than journals.\\nHere we have made some estimations for *Dimensions*,
      which showed a\\ncoverage of about 1160 (70%) of journals. The coverage was
      high also in\\nthe Global South, with 46 (41%) of African journals, against
      a 28 (25%)\\nin CAB Abstracts. Only for a few countries, including Iran, Germany,\\nRomania
      or Cuba, was *Dimensions* coverage lower than *CAB Abstracts*.  \\n\\nThe downside
      of these new, more comprehensive databases (alongside with\\nthe Google Scholar
      Coverage) is the lack of inquiry of the publishing\\npractices of journals.
      We found that some of the journals included in\\nthe larger databases, but not
      present in the more traditional databases\\nsuch as CAB Abstracts, have a higher
      incidence of problematic or\\nquestionable editorial and review practices (here
      the term ['predatory'\\nis\\nunhelpful](https://www-ub-edu.translate.goog/blokdebid/es/content/ineficiencias-defectos-y-practicas-fraudulentas-en-la-comunicacion-cientifica-abriendo-el?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=es-419&_x_tr_pto=wapp){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\n\\n###
      Another bibliographic coverage is possible, and necessary\\n\\nIn conclusion,
      another bibliographic world is possible where knowledge\\nis more diverse and
      accessible -- and this is important for agricultural\\nresearch to be more visible
      and accessible in and from the Global South.\\nInfrastructures towards this
      transformation have to be developed to\\nenhance interoperability and cooperation.
      This is the case, for example,\\nof the analysis centres that feed the FAO\\\\'s
      [AGRIS information\\nsystem](https://agris.fao.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      including grey\\nliterature. While currently no single commercial bibliographic
      database\\nhas a good coverage of agriculture, a new generation of databases
      in\\nconjunction with metadata aggregators from open access repositories may\\nhelp
      fill this gap. This increase in diversity of journals comes at the\\ncost of
      having a larger greyscale of rigour in journal editorial\\npractices. This challenge
      could be overcome with catalogues of editorial\\npractices such as [DOAJ](https://doaj.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      or\\n[Latindex](https://latindex.org/latindex/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} and\\nplatforms
      such as [MIAR](https://miar.ub.edu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nIt is about
      time to create more comprehensive open infrastructures to\\nprovide visibility
      and accessibility of agricultural knowledge relevant\\nto many more contexts,
      particularly in the Global South, so that\\nknowledge of appropriate technologies
      can foster human development\\nacross all the world.\\n\\n**Acknowledgement:**

      introduced the CWTS knowledge agenda 2023-2028. Building on this, in\\nthe current
      post we present the new focal areas in which CWTS organizes\\nits activities.
      These focal areas address key challenges in the way\\nscience is practiced and
      governed, in particular challenges for which we\\nbelieve our centre is uniquely
      positioned to make a difference and to\\ncontribute to transformative changes.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/20230509-focal-areas-of-CWTS.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"34092\\\"
      alt=\\\"The focal areas of CWTS\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\n### Focal areas\\n\\nMost
      of our activities at CWTS take place in three focal areas:\\nEngagement & Inclusion,
      Evaluation & Culture, and Information &\\nOpenness. These focal areas were launched
      on January 1, 2023, replacing\\nthe three research groups in which CWTS was
      organized until the end of\\n2022. While the research groups represented disciplinary
      traditions in\\nscience studies research, the focal areas are organized around
      key\\nchallenges faced by the research system. This reflects a major shift in\\nour
      way of working at CWTS.\\n\\nEach focal area consists of a core group of about
      eight to ten senior\\nstaff members and a broader group of PhD candidates and
      other\\nearly-career staff members as well as visiting researchers. A focal
      area\\nhas a small coordinating team that includes both senior researchers and\\na
      colleague with expertise in project coordination. To benefit from\\nsynergies
      between the focal areas, several staff members are\\ncontributing to two areas.\\n\\nThe
      box below summarizes the topics addressed by the focal areas. While\\neach focal
      area covers a distinct set of problems, the areas are also\\nclosely interconnected.
      The selection of the topics addressed by the\\nfocal areas is the outcome of
      an intensive consultative process\\ninvolving the entire CWTS team. By focusing
      on these topics, we aim to\\nset clear priorities and to maximize the impact
      of our work. The\\nimportance of setting priorities was emphasized in the evaluation
      of our\\ncentre that took place last year. In its advice, the evaluation\\ncommittee
      also identified topics that it felt may deserve more attention\\nin the work
      of our centre. The suggestions made by the committee have\\nproven very useful
      in defining the focal areas.  \\n\\n::: {style=\\\"background-color: #f3f3f3;

      {#engagement-inclusion style=\\\"width:100%; text-align:center;\\\"}\\n\\nThe
      focal area *Engagement & Inclusion* aims to contribute to a more\\ncollaborative,
      engaged, and inclusive research system. We believe in\\npromoting diversity
      and inclusion in the global scientific workforce,\\nand in recognizing the essential
      role that communication and co-creation\\nof scholarly activities play in strengthening
      such a diverse system. The\\nfocal area approaches these questions through strategic
      ambitions around\\nthe three pillars of the CWTS knowledge agenda: *understanding*,\\n*intervening*,
      and *practicing*. Examples of such ambitions include\\nimproving our understanding
      of the role of epistemic diversity in\\nknowledge creation, developing policy
      recommendations for more inclusive\\nand diverse academic careers, and taking
      more proactive measures to\\nco-create our own activities with a larger variety
      of societal\\nstakeholders (e.g., NGOs, educational organizations, and citizens).\\n\\n####
      [Evaluation & Culture](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/transforming-research-culture-introducing-the-evaluation-culture-focal-area-at-cwts){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      {#evaluation-culture style=\\\"width:100%; text-align:center;\\\"}\\n\\nThe
      focal area *Evaluation & Culture* is concerned with the many\\ndifferent ways
      in which research is evaluated, for instance through\\nassessment of research
      institutions and individual researchers, and\\nthrough peer review in publishing
      and funding contexts. Recognizing the\\nmutual shaping of research and research
      evaluation, we are committed to\\npromoting forms of evaluation that are suited
      to diverse knowledge\\nmaking practices and that foster healthy and inclusive
      academic working\\nenvironments. The focal area combines activities in the *understanding*,\\n*intervening*,
      and *practicing* pillars of the CWTS knowledge agenda. We\\nwant to better understand
      how research evaluation in its many forms\\nconditions research agendas, notions
      of quality, and daily practices of\\nresearch and scholarly communication. In
      addition, we aim to use our\\ninsights to promote positive change, for example
      by advising\\ninstitutions like universities and funding bodies on how to organize\\nevaluation
      for epistemic and social inclusivity, diversity, and\\nopenness. Lastly, we
      aim to practice our values by constantly reflecting\\non how we do evaluation
      in our immediate working environment.\\n\\n#### [Information & Openness](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/toward-open-research-information-introducing-the-information-openness-focal-area-at-cwts){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      {#information-openness style=\\\"width:100%; text-align:center;\\\"}\\n\\nThe
      focal area *Information & Openness* is concerned with studying and\\nadvancing
      openness of research information, such as information about\\nthe activities
      and outputs of researchers and research institutions. We\\nbelieve that openness
      of research information can play an important role\\nin fostering responsible
      research assessment practices and promoting\\nglobal inclusiveness in science.
      The activities of the focal area\\nrevolve around the *understanding*, *intervening*,
      and *practicing*\\npillars of the CWTS knowledge agenda. We aim to develop a
      deep\\nunderstanding of the open research information landscape and to monitor\\nthe
      openness of research information. We also intend to develop\\ninitiatives that
      promote openness of research information as the norm\\nfor scientometric analyses.
      In addition, we are putting the use of open\\nresearch information into practice
      in our own work. The work of CWTS\\nwill increasingly be based on open rather
      than closed research\\ninformation, making our work more transparent, reproducible,
      and\\ninclusive.\\n:::\\n\\n### Strategic ambitions\\n\\nThe focal areas are
      currently developing strategic ambitions for the\\nperiod 2023-2028. Each focal
      area organizes its strategic ambitions in\\nthree pillars:\\n\\n- ***Understanding:***
      Ambitions that focus on developing a deeper\\n  understanding of the problems
      addressed in the focal area.\\n\\n- ***Intervening:*** Ambitions that contribute
      to improving the research\\n  system, for instance through Horizon Europe projects,
      products and\\n  services of [CWTS BV](https://www.cwtsbv.nl/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      and\\n  also through training, advocacy, and contributions to policy making.\\n\\n-
      ***Practicing:*** Ambitions that contribute to improving our own way\\n  of
      working at CWTS ('practice what we preach').\\n\\nWhile a research centre may
      traditionally be expected to focus primarily\\non *understanding*, for our centre\_*intervening*
      is of equal importance.\\nAs discussed in [our previous blog\\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-knowledge-agenda-2023-2028),\\nthe
      mission of CWTS is to improve how science is practiced and governed\\nand how
      it serves society. Realizing this mission requires us to invest\\nour efforts
      both in *understanding* and in *intervening*. In addition,\\nrecognizing that
      we are part of the research system ourselves, we also\\nfeel a special responsibility
      to improve our own way of working by\\n*practicing* what we preach, for instance
      in areas such as [open\\nscience](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/practicing-what-we-preach-our-journey-toward-open-science)\\nand
      [recognition and\\nrewards](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/responsible-research-culture-practicing-what-we-preach-at-cwts).\\n\\nAt
      the moment the focal areas are working hard to finalize the\\ndevelopment of
      their strategic ambitions in the *understanding*,\\n*intervening*, and *practicing*
      pillars. They expect to announce their\\nplans in the coming months.  \\n\\n###
      Next steps\\n\\nThe focal areas, along with new ambitions in the *understanding*,\\n*intervening*,
      and *practicing* pillars, represent a major change in our\\nway of working at
      CWTS. The full implementation of these key elements in\\nthe CWTS knowledge
      agenda 2023-2028 will take time. We therefore see\\n2023 and 2024 as a transition
      period in which the knowledge agenda will\\nbe further elaborated and fine-tuned
      and in which the introduction of a\\nnew way of working at our centre will be
      completed.\\n\\nWe expect that the Leiden Madtrics blog will be used to provide
      further\\nupdates on the development of the knowledge agenda and the focal areas.\\nKeep
      an eye on future blog posts!\\n\\n*We thank the focal area coordinators for
      preparing the brief\\ndescriptions of the focal areas presented in this blog
      post.*  \\n\",\"published_at\":1683624900,\"updated_at\":1737279956,\"registered_at\":0,\"indexed_at\":1731078596,\"authors\":[{\"name\":

      has gained significant momentum over the past few years,\\nwith various movements
      and initiatives emerging to promote sharing of\\nscientific knowledge, data,
      and resources with the wider community. Open\\nscience is a broad term encompassing
      a range of practices that strive to\\nincrease transparency, inclusivity, and
      accessibility in science. The\\nexpected benefits of open science are manifold,
      from accelerating\\nscientific progress, enhancing scientific rigour, promoting
      responsible\\nresearch, and ensuring public trust in science.\\n\\nWith that
      in mind, the research councils of the Netherlands (NWO) and\\nNorway (RCN) joined
      hands with CWTS to organize a seminar series on open\\nscience throughout 2022.
      The seminars aimed to enrich and expand the\\nunderstanding of open science
      within the agencies, focusing on programme\\nand policy officers and connected
      professionals interested in the\\nsubject.\\n\\nAware of the challenges to reaching
      all those interested within NWO and\\nRCN, we decided to create a knowledge
      platform to store and share the\\ncontent from the seminars so they could be
      attended asynchronously.\\nMoreover, recognizing the value of the produced content
      to a broader\\naudience, we decided to put the idea of openness into practice,
      making\\nthe platform open to the public.\\n\\n### [**The knowledge platform**](https://open-science.cwts.nl/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nThe
      knowledge platform features videos from the seminar series\\npresentations,
      including lectures from Thed van Leeuwen, Ludo Waltman,\\nWolfgang Kaltenbrunner,
      and myself. Open science champions, as we call\\nthe many experts that shared
      experiences and their perspectives with our\\naudience, are also there. Additionally,
      the platform includes support\\nmaterials, access to the slides used in our
      presentations, links to\\nrelevant resources and literature, and more.\\n\\nThe
      seminar series consisted of four individual seminars, included as\\ndifferent
      sections in the platform. Each one of them covered specific\\naspects of open
      science:\\n\\n#### [*Introduction to open science*](https://open-science.cwts.nl/introduction/introduction-to-os-five-schools-of-open-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nThe
      first seminar provided an overview of the complexity of open science\\nas more
      of an umbrella term than a well-defined concept. From that\\nperspective, open
      science refers to a series of movements to remove\\nbarriers to sharing any
      scientific output, resources, methods, or tools\\nand bringing scientific results
      closer to the general public. Through a\\nseries of examples, we adopted the
      model of five schools of thought\\nproposed by [Fecher and\\nFriesike](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-00026-8_2){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n(2014)
      to understand open science in its multiple dimensions, from being\\ndemocratic
      to its role in recognition and rewards.\\n\\n#### *[Open scholarly communication](https://open-science.cwts.nl/introduction/open-scholarly-communication){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}*\\n\\nThe
      second seminar delved into open scholarly communication. It covered\\ntopics
      such as open access publishing, article processing charges\\n(APCs), Plan S,
      pre-printing, and open peer review. The seminar also\\ncovered newer forms of
      scholarly publishing, with diverse levels of\\nopenness, and the transition
      towards a more democratic future in\\nscience.\\n\\n#### [*Open data, software
      and infrastructures*](https://open-science.cwts.nl/introduction/open-data-software-and-infrastructures){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nThe
      third seminar focused on aspects connected to the infrastructure\\nschool of
      open science, including open data, how to make data FAIR\\n(Findable, Accessible,
      Interoperable, and Reusable), and data management\\nplans, as well as recent
      developments in the sharing of code and\\nsoftware. The seminar also covered
      necessary infrastructures for open\\nscience, such as repositories.\\n\\n####
      [*Recognition & rewards and responsible research assessment*](https://open-science.cwts.nl/introduction/recognition-and-rewards-and-responsible-research-assessment){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      {#recognition-rewards-and-responsible-research-assessment}\\n\\nThe fourth seminar
      approached an important ongoing development in the\\nacademic world, connecting
      openness to issues related to recognition &\\nrewards and responsible research
      assessment. The seminar covered the\\ncurrent state of those issues and the
      challenges that arise from them.\\nIt also discussed responsible research assessment,
      the development of\\nnational matrixes for career assessment, the movement towards
      adopting\\nnarrative CVs, and the importance of transparency and reproducibility
      in\\nopen science.\\n\\n### Next steps\\n\\nTo call something a knowledge platform
      is undoubtedly ambitious. Our\\nfour open science seminars were designed to
      introduce fundamental\\nconcepts and to put these in the context of ongoing
      policy initiatives.\\nWe recognize there is still much more to explore, so we
      built the\\nplatform to be updated and expanded. In this way, new topics can
      be\\nadded to follow the development of open science and enrich the\\nplatform\\\\'s
      content.\\n\\nFor instance, at CWTS, we already plan to delve into topics such
      as the\\nopen science pillars proposed by the [UNESCO Recommendation on Open\\nScience](https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      the convergence of open science and Responsible Research and\\nInnovation (RRI).
      We are also interested, for instance, in learning from\\nthe Global South\\\\'s
      efforts in the diamond open access model over the\\npast two decades.\\n\\nWe
      also welcome contributions from new open science champions, as the\\nplatform
      is open to growth and development. If you would like to be part\\nof this effort,
      please reach out [to\\nme](mailto:a.l.brasil@cwts.leidenuniv.nl){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      Launching\\nthe open science knowledge platform is a first step to something
      bigger,\\nto a dynamic resource that evolves, reflecting the constantly changing\\nnature
      of open science.\\n\\n### **Reflections on a co-creation process**\\n\\nThe
      journey to prepare our seminar series and organize the contents into\\na knowledge
      platform has been quite interesting and rewarding. While we\\nhad the chance
      to debate the state of the art of open science within\\nCWTS, we had to build
      a practical program that could be valuable to\\nthose working with the topic
      at different levels, including funding,\\nevaluation, and policy design. That
      was a mission accomplished by\\nadopting a co-creation perspective with our
      partners at NWO and RCN. So,\\nwe very much like to thank Maria Cruz, Anthony
      Gadsdon, Marte Qvenild,\\nand Christian Lund not only for fruitful discussions
      around the program\\nand the outcomes, but also for an active partnership in
      every seminar.\\n\\nFurthermore, it's also quite important for us to thank our
      champions.\\nEarly in the design of the seminar series, we decided to invite\\nadditional
      experts to contribute with their own ideas, perspectives, and\\nexperiences
      on open science. The nine champions that joined us have\\nexpanded our own understanding
      on open science and helped us create a\\nmuch more comprehensive seminars than
      we would be able to do alone. So,\\nwe also extend our thanks to Sonja Grossberndt,
      Sanli Faez, John Arne\\nR\xF8ttingen, Anne Scheel, Anna van't Veer, Marjan Grootveld,
      Korbinian\\nB\xF6ls, Kim Huijpen, and Alexander Jensenius.\\n\\nAnd with that,

      aims to\\ncontribute to making available the information needed by these\\nstakeholders.
      \ \\n\\n### The current landscape, and its shortcomings\\n\\nThere are numerous
      initiatives and platforms providing some part of the\\npuzzle, but information
      is scattered, incomplete, and difficult to\\ncompare. For example, tools and
      databases are available that help\\nresearchers understand how to make their
      research openly accessible\\n(DOAJ), whether their work can be posted in a repository
      or on a\\npreprint server (Sherpa Romeo), how to ensure compliance with funder\\nrequirements
      (Plan S Journal Checker Tool), and how to pick a\\npublication platform that
      offers particular peer review approaches\\n(Transpose), open science practices
      (TOP factor), or that is considered\\nto have a sufficiently high citation impact
      (Journal Citation Reports).\\n\\nGiven this complexity, it seems unrealistic
      to expect stakeholders to\\nknow which tools or databases to use to obtain specific
      information.\\n\\nAs new models of publishing such as Publish-Review-Curate,
      publication\\nas you go, preprint review and others emerge, distinct publishing\\nfunctions
      like dissemination and evaluation are increasingly decoupled.\\nThis creates
      the need for different platforms to interact and at least\\nto be aware of each
      other's policies and requirements. At present, there\\nare minimal standards
      to enable the systematic interoperability of these\\nplatforms. At the research
      output level, standards like\\n[DocMaps](https://docmaps.knowledgefutures.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      and\\nthe [COAR\\nNotify](https://www.coar-repositories.org/notify/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nprotocol
      are under development. However, to empower further innovation\\nin scholarly
      communication, a shared way to describe these different\\nplatforms and their
      possibilities of interaction is required.  \\n\\n### The Journal Observatory
      project: aims and approach\\n\\nTo address this challenge, our project aims
      to:  \\n\\n1.  define an extensible, machine-readable and traceable way to describe\\n
      \   the policies and practices of the various platforms involved in\\n    disseminating
      and evaluating scholarly works: the **Scholarly\\n    Communication Platform
      Framework  \\n    **\\n\\n2.  demonstrate the value of this new framework by
      building a\\n    demonstration prototype called the **Journal Observatory**,
      a\\n    resource which combines data on journals and other publication\\n    platforms
      from various sources to clarify policy information for\\n    authors, reviewers
      and others.\\n\\n#### **1. Scholarly Communication Platform Framework** {#scholarly-communication-platform-framework}\\n\\n[The
      Scholarly Communication Platform\\nFramework](https://www.journalobservatory.org/framework/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nis
      a new, high-level, structured language that enables the exchange of\\ninformation
      about platforms for scholarly communication. To date, we\\nhave focused on enabling
      description of platforms for the dissemination\\nand/or evaluation of research
      articles, such as scientific journals,\\npreprint servers, and peer review platforms.
      However, the Framework can\\nfairly easily be extended in the future to describe
      platforms performing\\nother scholarly communication functions (e.g., archiving
      via platforms\\nlike LOCKKS/CLOCKKS or Portico), or to describe dissemination/evaluation\\nof
      other types of scholarly outputs (books, datasets, software, code,\\nmethods,
      materials). The detailed inner-workings and rationale of the\\nFramework are
      described in our [technical\\nreport](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7860610){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nDocumentation
      and source code can be found on the [project's\\nwebpage](https://www.journalobservatory.org/framework/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      \ \\n\\n#### **2. Journal Observatory prototype** {#journal-observatory-prototype}\\n\\nThe
      Journal Observatory prototype is a proof-of-concept demonstrator\\nwhich integrates
      journal information from diverse open data sources\\nincluding DOAJ, Sherpa
      Romeo and others, as well as directly from\\npublishers. It shows the power
      of combining information from these\\ndifferent sources to support three primary
      use-case areas: open access\\npublishing, preprinting and peer review procedures.
      By making this\\ninformation available, we support researchers, publishers,
      funders and\\nresearch institutions to make informed decisions and monitor compliance.\\nThe
      prototype comes both with interfaces for machines and with a\\nuser-friendly
      web interface for humans. There are two interfaces for\\nmachines: a [SPARQL\\nendpoint](https://sparql.journalobservatory.org/sparql){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      a [REST API](https://api.journalobservatory.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThe
      web interface for humans is provided by the [Journal Observatory\\nBrowser](https://app.journalobservatory.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      More\\ninformation about the prototype, including documentation and source\\ncode,
      can be found on the [project's\\nwebpage](https://www.journalobservatory.org/prototype/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.

      alt=\\\"The Journal Observatory\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\n### **Next steps**\\n\\nThe
      Journal Observatory project has achieved much within a limited\\ntimeframe and
      with limited resources. We see our project and its outputs\\nas the start or
      continuation, not the end, of a much larger\\nconversation. We hope our work
      will provide a base for a more ambitious\\nlong-term agenda, co-shaped with
      the wider scholarly community, and\\naimed at working toward open and interoperable
      infrastructure for\\nproviding systematic and reliable information on scholarly
      journals and\\nother scholarly communication platforms.  \\n\\n### **The community
      event**\\n\\nTo mark the end of the project and to launch the project's results,
      we\\norganized an [online community\\nevent](https://www.journalobservatory.org/event/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      on\\nApril 25. During the event, we presented our work, including a live demo\\nof
      the Journal Observatory Browser to show how the tool can support\\nusers in
      efficiently finding answers to questions like: what journals in\\nmy field (e.g.
      sustainability research) provide options for Diamond Open\\nAccess publishing?
      How do the preprinting policies of two journals\\ncompare? What journals in
      my field adhere to Open Peer Review, in the\\nsense of publishing review reports?
      \ \\n\\nThe demonstration was followed by Lucy Ofiesh's (Director of Finance
      &\\nOperations at Crossref) talk on the Principles of Open Scholarly\\nInfrastructure
      (POSI). Lucy described how these principles, developed as\\na community resource
      to help guide organizations, can support the\\nresilience and sustainability
      of open infrastructure that serves the\\nscholarly communications ecosystem.\\n\\nThe
      event was concluded by a panel discussion in which three of the\\nproject's
      stakeholder advisory board members discussed their perspective\\non the need
      and future of interoperable, systematically-collected\\ninformation on scholarly
      communication platforms. Johan Rooryck\\n(Executive Director of cOAlition S),
      Catriona MacCallum (Director of\\nOpen Science at Hindawi Publishing) and Gabe
      Stein (Head of Operations\\nand Product at the Knowledge Futures Group) shared
      their view from the\\nperspective of a research agency coalition, publisher
      and infrastructure\\nprovider, respectively. They agreed that there is a dire
      need for the\\nkind of service provided by initiatives like the Journal Observatory\\nproject,
      but also identified several challenges on the road towards\\nsustainability
      of such initiatives.\\n\\nThe recording of the event can be watched\\n[here](https://www.journalobservatory.org/event/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      \ \\n\\n### **Get involved!**\\n\\nWe call upon all within the scholarly communications

      administrators, and from there to the\\ntop-management in the higher education

      get fuzzy --- not to\\nmention difficult --- given the [scarce resources dedicated
      to research\\nand development in middle and low-income\\ncountries](https://www.unesco.org/reports/science/2021/en/report-series){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nTake
      Latin America and the Caribbean as an example. There are no\\nLatin-American
      companies listed in [Clarivate\\\\'s Top-100 Global\\nInnovators](https://clarivate.com/top-100-innovators/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nIn
      addition, as of 2022 there are only two companies ranked in the\\n[SCImago Institutions\\nRanking](https://www.scimagoir.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      which assesses\\ninstitutions worldwide in terms of research performance, innovation\\noutput,
      and societal impact. Those companies were Petrobras and Estacio\\nParticipacoes
      AS. Petrobras is one of the largest companies in the\\npetroleum industry in
      the region, while Estacio Participacoes focuses on\\nprivate educational services
      in Brazil.\\n\\nGiven the absence of Latin-American private organizations in
      the global\\ninnovation sphere, it is both relevant and urgent to identify highly\\nstrategic
      research fields in regions with restricted financial resources\\nand underdeveloped
      industry ecosystems. For instance, in 2019 the\\naverage [research and development
      expenditure in the region was a mere\\n0.7%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GB.XPD.RSDV.GD.ZS?locations=XJ){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nAlso,
      it is of high value to map research fields\\nstill-to-be-explored-and-exploited
      via Industry-University partnerships.\\n\\n### Mapping the research-fronts of
      industry in Latin America and the Caribbean\\n\\nIn a [study published in the
      Journal of Information\\nScience](https://doi.org/10.1177/01655515221131796){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      I\\nidentified highly strategic research-fronts for both industry and\\nresearch
      intensive institutions, universities among them, in Latin\\nAmerica and the
      Caribbean. I applied a technique used to establish\\ninterconnections and clustering
      between knowledge domains. This\\ntechnique is called [bibliographic\\ncoupling](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.5090140103){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nThe
      bibliographic coupling approach enables us to examine the underlying\\nstructure
      of the knowledge required for researchers to produce new\\nknowledge. This technique
      is quite versatile. It can process highly\\nmultidisciplinary amounts of research
      documents, such as research on the\\n[Sustainable Development\\nGoals](https://clarivate.com/lp/navigating-the-structure-of-research-on-sustainable-development-goals-2/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nor
      the [complete set of articles published in the journal\\n*Nature*](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03308-7){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      150 years of history.\\n\\nThe approach for coupling two documents is straightforward.
      See the\\nfigure below this paragraph. Let\\\\'s suppose that I\\\\'m writing
      an article\\non biotechnology (A, in Figure 1), and you, the reader, are writing
      an\\narticle on bioeconomy (B, in Figure 1). We do not know each other.\\nHowever,
      we found an interesting article or any other type of scholarly\\ncommunication
      such as a book chapter, policy paper, and the like, on\\n*thebioeconomy of biotech*
      (C, in Figure 1). Now, we read and assess\\nthat scholarly communication, and
      decide to include it in our own study.\\nWe cite it and by that common citation
      our documents are now connected.\\nThe same applies to the fields of research
      of publication A and B:\\nBecause of A and B being connected, biotechnology
      and bioeconomy now\\nshare a link as well.  \\n\\nIn this first step, the bibliographic
      coupling detects the shared\\nreferences between research articles to interconnect
      them. Then, in a\\nsecond step, it is also feasible to interconnect the research
      field of\\nthe journals in which those articles were published, thereby assembling\\na
      network of research fields based on the research articles coupled.  \\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/bibliographic_coupling_II.png\\\"\\nalt=\\\"Bibliographic
      coupling II\\\" />\\n<figcaption>Figure 1. Bibliographic coupling.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nI
      applied this process to a sample of 13,000+ research articles indexed\\nin the
      bibliographic database\\n[Scopus](https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/scopus){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThe
      articles sourced had to be coauthored by at least one author\\naffiliated with
      an institution in Latin America and the Caribbean ---\\neither public or private
      ---, and the same author or another coauthor\\naffiliated with a private organization
      in any other country.\\n\\nAs I previously mentioned, the bibliographic coupling
      enables us to\\ninterconnect the research articles produced with industry collaboration\\nand
      the underlying structure of the knowledge required for their\\ndevelopment.
      Once these articles and the academic journals in which they\\nwere published
      were identified, I use the research fields\\\\'\\nclassification of the journals
      to assemble a research field network as\\nfollows.\\n\\nEach academic journal
      indexed in Scopus receives a classification to a\\nsingle or multiple research
      field based on the [All Science Journal\\nClassification](https://service.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/15181/supporthub/scopus/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nsystem.
      There are over 330 research fields, categorized into five areas,\\nnamely physical
      sciences, life sciences, health sciences, social\\nsciences & humanities, and
      multidisciplinary. In consequence, if two\\narticles connected via bibliographic
      coupling were published in a\\njournal with two classifications such as biotechnology
      and\\nbioengineering, and a second journal with a single classification in\\nmolecular
      medicine, the research field network based on these two\\njournals is composed
      by three interconnected fields: biotechnology,\\nbioengineering, and molecular
      medicine.\\n\\nAlso, I calculated betweenness centrality, [an\\nindicator](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-021-01222-2){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nfor
      each research field that unveils its strategic position within the\\nnetwork.
      Figure 2 shows the network layout with the research-fields with\\nhigh strategic
      position, proportional to the size of the nodes. Also, it\\nshows the time of
      the first publication of a given research-field.  \\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/research-fronts_III_880_2023-04-12-100133_cbwp.png\\\"\\nalt=\\\"Research

      Physical science, the most active. Multidisciplinary, the most strategic  {#physical-science-the-most-active.-multidisciplinary-the-most-strategic}\\n\\nResults
      showed that multiple research-fields from different research\\nareas were active
      in industry-research collaborations (further on called\\nindustry research fronts).
      Physical science had the most active role.\\nThe least active role went to social
      sciences and humanities.\\n\\nThe research area of physical science with fields
      such as computer\\nscience applications, information systems, electrical & electronic\\nengineering,
      energy engineering and power technology took about \\\\~38% of\\nthe total nodes
      of the network. Health sciences made up 23% of the\\nnodes. In this area, we
      can find research-fields such as public health,\\nenvironmental and occupational
      health, or general medicine. For the case\\nof life sciences, an area with \\\\~19%
      of the nodes, we can find\\nresearch-fields such as genetics, pharmacology,
      or agronomy and crop\\nscience. Finally, for social sciences and humanities,
      with \\\\~18% of the\\nfields, we can find fields such as strategy and management,
      geography,\\nplanning and development, or economics and econometrics.\\n\\nDespite
      having just one node in the network, the area of\\nmultidisciplinary research
      had the highest betweenness centrality.\\nMultidisciplinary research was mostly
      published in scientific journals\\nsuch as [PLoS\\nONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/journal-information){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nAccording
      to this journal, they accept: \\\\\\\"[over two hundred subject\\nareas across
      science, engineering, medicine, and the related social\\nsciences and\\nhumanities](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/journal-information){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\\\\\\"\\nTherefore,
      it is quite difficult to dimension multidisciplinary research\\nas a single
      research front, despite its highly strategic position in the\\nresearch fronts
      network. More so, to outline specific recommendations\\nand a plausible course
      of action to follow through the\\nIndustry-University partnership.\_\\n\\n###
      Uncharted research-fronts\\n\\nThrough recognizing research fronts, I could
      determine which\\nresearch-fields had yet to be explored or exploited by\\nindustry-institutions.
      Most of these research-fields were from health\\nsciences, such as emergency
      medicine, care planning, or optometry,\\nfollowed by fields in the social sciences
      and humanities, such\\ndemography or life-span and life-course studies.\\n\\nHere
      lie plausible interconnections between the aforementioned uncharted\\nfields.
      For instance, [the number of US citizens aged over 65 is\\nprojected to double
      by\\n2060](https://www.prb.org/resources/fact-sheet-aging-in-the-united-states/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nIs
      it a tangible research front plausibly formed by care planning and\\ndemography?
      Is it a potential research front for industry-research\\ninstitutions in Latin
      America and the Caribbean?\\n\\nWhat I have discussed here could be of great
      use to industry and\\nresearch institutions. As a first insight, both parties
      can identify\\nmature and emergent research fronts and assess how strategic
      their\\nresearch capacities are amid the bibliographic network structure.\\nSecond,
      they can identify research fields clustered nearby and gauge how\\nlikely or
      attractive it might be to delve into different fields.\\nFinally, parties can
      see more clearly which research fields are still\\nunexplored by joint efforts
      between research institutions and industry.\\nFurther studies could also source
      other types of research institutions\\nand industry knowledge outputs such as
      patents and patent-citation data\\nto expand industry and research institution
      endeavors.  \\n\\n[  \\nHeader image:\_Laurel and Michael Evans on\\n[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/mfq1Bml-ITY?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}[](https://unsplash.com/photos/D_YZmKGSyic?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}]{.caption}\\n\",\"published_at\":1681374600,\"updated_at\":1737279956,\"registered_at\":0,\"indexed_at\":1731078596,\"authors\":[{\"name\":

      come back to Taiwan. When I learned that the STI 2022 conference\\nwould be
      held physically, I was very excited about returning to Europe\\nand reconnecting
      with the colleagues over there. Due to the\\nCovid-measures in place in Taiwan,
      it was not certain from the beginning\\nthat I would actually be able to attend
      the conference, but in the end\\nit all worked out. I was privileged to attend
      the STI 2022 conference\\nand extremely grateful for this opportunity. My trip
      was relatively\\nshort, and I did not have much time to enjoy the beautiful
      scenery of\\nGranada. People might wonder if attending the conference for less
      than a\\nweek was worth traveling here from a faraway country. I did remember
      one\\ncolleague asking me this question, and my answer was, \\\"Yes, definitely.\\\"\\n\\n###
      What reconnecting means to me\\n\\nIt is because I reconnected to the center
      of the bibliometric community\\nagain! As a researcher from faraway Asia, I
      sometimes felt lost because\\nmany new topics have not yet been discussed at
      my place. Attending the\\nSTI conference live again gave me an excellent opportunity
      to follow the\\nlatest trends and have face-to-face discussions with my international\\npeers.
      For instance, I noticed more and more studies and discussions\\nabout open infrastructures
      and new databases like Overton. The topic of\\ndiversity has gained more attention,
      with bibliometric analyses\\nsupporting policy-making in this area. Triangulating
      quantitative and\\nqualitative analyses has become more common. Many interesting
      works\\nrelated to funding policy also allowed me to understand the funding\\nmechanisms
      in European countries better. I could even get in touch with\\nparticipants
      who work at funding organizations. Not to mention that it\\nwas great to know
      who else is studying OA publishing and APCs, which is\\none of my research interests.\\n\\nMoreover,
      I made some personal \\\"breakthroughs\\\". For instance, it was my\\nfirst
      time hosting an STI conference session, my first presentation on\\ninternational
      collaboration, and my first time being part of the\\nreviewers. I have learned
      a lot from preparation to presentation, which\\ngave me more confidence.\\n\\nBesides
      that, I also attended the first-ever \\\\\\\"[*Women in Science Policy\\n(WISP)*](https://twitter.com/Women_SciPolicy){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\\"
      event at\\nthe conference. This was organized by Gemma Derrick, Cassidy R. Sugimoto\\nand
      Caroline Wagner,\_who attempted to advocate for acknowledging women\\nin science
      policy to relevant stakeholders and to build up the network\\nfor female researchers
      to coordinate matches between mentors and\\nmentees. All female participants
      from different career stages were\\ninvited to attend this event on the first
      day after the reception\\ncocktail. The senior female researchers were genuinely
      willing to share\\ntheir experiences. When they heard questions from the junior\\nresearchers,
      they even would introduce other senior researchers who had\\nsimilar backgrounds
      or had encountered similar issues before to juniors.\\nFor me, I did get to
      know more female researchers during the WISP event.\\nIt was a more relaxed
      environment than the coffee breaks during the\\ndaytime. The atmosphere, in
      general, was great. It did create a safe and\\nfriendly space without any burden.
      Usually, during coffee breaks, people\\nupdate each other on research progress
      and career status, discuss their\\nthoughts on the last session or plenary meeting,
      or introduce and\\nexchange contact information in a hurry. At the WISP, I felt
      more\\ncomfortable asking questions and seeking advice like career planning.\\n\\nOf
      course, some of these observations and experiences could also have\\nbeen achieved
      via online conferences, but the live and immediate\\ndiscussions with international
      peers is the most valuable thing. It is\\nsomething that is hardly replaced
      by virtual conferences. Real-time and\\nphysical conferences provide opportunities
      for connecting. We can\\ninteract through more frequent social events like coffee
      breaks,\\nlunches, and dinners. It also gives us a more flexible schedule for
      \\\"pre\\nand post-conference activity\\\" to enhance the connection. Grasping
      the\\nopportunity to explore the city on the day before the conference starts\\nor
      extending the happy-hour time after the conference ends is a way to\\nget to
      know our colleagues better.\\n\\n### Hybrid conferences -- a compromise? {#hybrid-conferences-a-compromise}\\n\\nEven
      though online conference formats may hardly replace the real and\\nlive interactions
      during physical conferences, attending international\\nconferences has its economic
      and environmental costs and may not always\\nbe possible or desired. Here is
      where hybrid conferences can be a\\nsolution and might even help to ensure inclusion
      and diversity. During\\nthe pandemic, organizing a conference in the online
      format let academic\\ncommunities get used to the new model of scholarly communication.\\n\\nBut
      how do we make online experiences as likeable as meeting physically?\\nI think
      the most important thing is: people online should not feel left\\nout or disconnected.
      Besides some issues with technical equipment or\\ninternet connection, we often
      see them being forgotten during\\ndiscussions. In that sense, ensuring every
      session host knows how to\\nhost hybrid conferences is essential.\\n\\nRegarding
      social activities, pure online conferences usually rely on\\nchatrooms or even
      games to proceed; however, it seems impossible to\\nengage people online and
      offline in the same social activities at the\\nsame time, for example, having
      a city tour together. This requires\\ncreative thinking to come up with approaches
      that make the conference\\nexperience enjoyable for both offline and online
      participants.  \\n\\n### Looking forward to STI 2023\\n\\nHere I would like
      to express my gratitude again to the organizing\\ncommittee of the STI 2022
      conference! I really appreciate the idea of\\ninviting more early career researchers
      to host sessions and organizing\\nthe WISP event to provide an excellent opportunity
      for female\\nresearchers to get to know each other, engage in conversations,
      and\\nexchange experiences. Now I am looking forward to the next one -- [STI\\n2023
      in Leiden](https://www.sti2023.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}. The\\norganizing
      committee has already [announced that it will be held in a\\nhybrid\\nway](https://twitter.com/Ednoyons/status/1568535459525001217?t=tRE7p6tYDkBGukYhtP8u_A&s=19){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nMoreover,
      the conference motto, \\\"*improving scholarly evaluation\\npractice in the
      light of cultural change,*\\\" triggers the ambition of\\ninnovating the conference
      format as well as the [submission and review\\nprocess](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/experimenting-with-open-science-practices-at-the-sti-2023-conference){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nLet\\\\'s

      CVs instead supplement traditional types of biographical\\ninformation with
      narrative elements through which researchers can tell\\nmore contextual stories
      about their background/ career/ career\\nmotivation. Ideally, narrative CVs
      can help diversify criteria of\\nsuccess and achievement in research, thereby
      also diversifying the\\nscientific workforce and creating more openness for
      \\\"irregular\\\" career\\ntrajectories.\\n\\nAgainst the backdrop of these
      debates, we organized [a 5-day workshop at\\nthe Lorentz Center in\\nLeiden](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/curricula-vitae-as-reproductive-interfaces-in-research.html){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      December 2022 to bring together different academic stakeholders\\n(including
      researchers, funders, policy makers, and administrators) to\\nreflect on these
      and other new developments in CV territory. In this\\npost we share some of
      our main insights. Urgent short-term goals include\\nthe need for getting a
      better sense of the extent to which narrative CVs\\ncan be effective in addressing
      the above-mentioned issues, and which\\npractical conditions must be met for
      them to achieve their potential. In\\nthe medium- to long run, we should ensure
      that current narrative CV\\nformats are part of a coordinated broader strategy
      to foster inclusive\\npractices in research evaluation.\\n\\n### Historical
      convergence vs a new diversity of CV formats\\n\\nNarrative CV formats can be
      seen as merely the latest development in the\\nevolution of the genre. [Research
      on the morphology of\\nCVs](https://academic.oup.com/rev/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/reseval/rvab040/6500313){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nhas
      for example shown that in the humanities in Germany, a narrative\\nformat has
      been gradually replaced by a tabular format during the second\\nhalf of the
      20th century. More research would be needed to substantiate\\nhow representative
      these findings are for CV practices in other fields\\nand countries. Yet overall,
      we can safely assume that CV formats have\\ntended to converge in recent decades,
      following a relatively universal\\nstructure based on a range of categories
      of achievements.\\n\\nThe standardization of formats is in many ways productive.
      For example,\\nit has made it possible to create overarching digital infrastructures\\nfor
      creating and handling CVs that can also then be reused for specific\\napplication
      purposes. During the workshop, we organized an open source\\ndata mining session
      that drew on the ORCID database, which contains a\\nwealth of biographical profiles
      by researchers that can be used to\\ninterrogate empirical questions about [academic
      career systems and\\nacademic\\ndynamics](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sjck6/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      At\\nthe same time, it is exactly the uniformity of CV formats that current\\nnarrative
      CV initiatives and other critical observers of research\\nevaluation systems
      take issue with, since it exerts a form of\\nnormalizing power on researchers
      that ultimately urges them to develop\\ntheir careers around a rather narrow
      range of categories of\\nachievement.  \\n\\n<figure style=\\\"float:right;
      margin-left:24px;\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/18sarah2-300x300.jpg\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"18292\\\"
      />\\n<figcaption>Visual CV, created by Sarah de Rijcke.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nThe
      narrative CV templates recently introduced by funders and\\nuniversities in
      turn are characterized by a diversity in structure and\\nformat. At the workshop,
      we took a particularly close look at CV formats\\nused by organizations who
      were also represented at our event, which\\nincluded the Luxembourg National
      Research Fund (FNR), the Swiss National\\nScience Fund (SNSF), and the Research
      Council of the Netherlands (NWO).\\nThe formats of the Swiss, Luxembourg, and
      Dutch research councils all\\nask for some narrative of the trajectory and scientific
      accomplishments\\nof a researcher. The Swiss format requires up to three shorter\\nnarratives,
      while the Luxembourg CV requires applicants to submit a\\npersonal statement
      and a personal profile. The format used by the Dutch\\nresearch council in turn
      is tailored to different career stages, with\\napplicants for more advanced
      funding programs being asked to include an\\naccount of their leadership expertise
      in the narrative. Even the very\\nterm narrative CV is not fully agreed-upon.
      Rather than creating a sharp\\ndistinction between narrative and non-narrative,
      most organizations\\nadopting such formats aim for a hybrid document that combines
      more\\ntraditional list-based information with narrative elements. One could\\nalso
      argue that interpreting any kind of CV\\nformat[](https://valuationstudies.liu.se/article/view/842/1024)[always\\nrequires
      an effort at\\nnarrativization](https://valuationstudies.liu.se/article/view/842/1024){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nso
      as to translate a list of achievements into a trajectory that makes\\nsense
      to human evaluators. These points, as well as the current variety\\nin novel
      CV formats, caution us not to think of narrative CV formats as\\na singular
      new paradigm replacing existing conventions. Nevertheless, we\\nwill in the
      following present some overarching questions that are\\npertinent to most if
      not all narrative CV formats.\\n\\n### Evaluative use of narrative CVs\\n\\nA
      basic assumption that seems to underpin narrative CV initiatives is\\nthat changing
      the way information is presented to reviewers will also\\nchange evaluation
      practices such as the issues discussed in review\\npanels. Yet this seems a
      rather strong supposition. If we think of peer\\nreview not simply as a mechanism
      for objectively comparing information\\nabout applicants but as a practice that
      is learned through socialization\\nin academic communities, then we should assume
      that making use of the\\naffordances of novel CV formats is not something that
      comes overnight.\\nInstead, we should perhaps expect a gradual process in which
      researchers\\nbecome familiar with the new format and make progressively more
      use of\\nits features. Empirical investigation into this may be useful, e.g.,
      how\\ndo panel members actually negotiate and interpret evaluative criteria\\nwhen
      using narrative CV formats? Do such practices change over time? In\\nthe short
      term, detailed empirical studies that compare how review\\npanels shortlist
      and select candidates when presented with narrative and\\ntraditional CVs would
      be desirable (see\\n[here](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/332844/Narrative%20CVs%20drive%20change%20in%20OR%20practice.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nfor
      a pertinent ongoing research project carried out at Cambridge\\nUniversity).\\n\\nThere
      may also be inadvertent risks in broadening the biographical\\ninformation that
      is given as input for reviewers. First, it may be that\\nsociocultural biases
      have a higher chance of coming to the fore. Imagine\\na scenario where sharing
      personal details such as sexual orientation,\\nage, ethnic origin or simply
      particular life choices predispose\\nreviewers for or against the author of
      the CV. Relatedly, reviewers may\\nbe inclined to evaluate those stories that
      resemble their own more\\npositively, a phenomenon often studied under the name
      of homophily. Both\\nbias and its specific form of homophily risk undermining
      ongoing\\nattempts to foster diversity, equity, and inclusion in academia. The\\npotential
      effects of bias and homophily may potentially be mitigated by\\nunconscious
      bias training, or by assuring reviewer panels are\\nsufficiently diverse in
      terms of gender, ethnic origin, nationality and\\ncareer stages. Again, empirical
      research on these questions would be\\ndesirable. Do bias and homophily occur
      less or more often when using\\nnarrative CVs? Are reviewers more likely to
      call each other out on bias\\nand is unconscious bias training a suitable answer?
      Alternatively, can\\npanels better deal with biases if they cultivate a practice
      making\\nimplicit biases explicit?  \\n\\n<figure style=\\\"float:left; margin-right:35px;margin-top:8px;\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/3annemijn2_300x300.jpg\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"18292\\\"

      Crafting narratives\\n\\nA whole other set of unresolved questions arise even
      before evaluation,\\nnamely in the practice of crafting a narrative. During
      the workshop, we\\nadopted a very broad perspective on representing oneself
      as an academic,\\neven experimenting with the use of AI-generated visualizations
      in CVs\\nthat resulted in [a live\\nexhibition](https://www.np3.nu/resumatic/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      hosted by\\nartists Ruud Akse and Zwaan Ipema in the art space NP3 in Groningen
      (the\\nimages in this blog post have been created during that session). While\\nnarrative
      CV formats currently abstain from any visualization elements,\\nthey do create
      the possibility to frame academic work in ways that\\nhighlight different dimensions
      of contributions. For example, this\\npotentially allows for focusing also on
      desirable but usually somewhat\\nundervalued aspects like actively practicing
      Open Science, communication\\nand engagement with society, teaching, or exerting
      leadership in\\ninnovative ways. And while narrative CVs focus on individual\\nresearchers,
      they principally allow for new ways of showing how\\nindividual researchers
      contribute to collaborative work -- for example,\\nby giving space to account
      for community-building work that does not\\nlead to publications and would normally
      remain invisible. At the same\\ntime, the practice of crafting a narrative is
      also related to\\nsociological power dynamics, for example to the command of
      cultural\\ncapital, which is unequally distributed across researchers in terms
      of\\ndemographic dimensions such as age and social origin. Crafting\\nnarratives
      after all requires much more tacit knowledge about \\\\\\\"how to\\npresent
      yourself\\\\\\\" than a standardized tabular format. In addition,\\ncrafting
      narratives may come easier for some personality types than\\nothers.\\n\\nThe
      prospect of writing a narrative also raises the question of how\\ncoherent the
      biographical account should be. Our workshop featured a\\ngroup work session
      chaired by Catelijne Coopmans in which we took a\\ncritical look at academic
      career advice. Academic career advice\\nresources often appear to help reproduce
      rather traditional assumptions\\nabout what it means to be a successful researcher.
      One of the takeaways\\nwas that the cost of conforming to perceived or real
      career requirements\\n[can be\\nhigh](https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/03/01/oxford-universitys-other-diversity-crisis){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nboth
      to building viable livelihoods and to health and wellbeing. Many\\nresearchers
      still work under the assumption that the goal of doing\\nacademic research is
      to become a professor, while other career paths are\\nperceived as a form of
      failure. In reality, \\\"irregular\\\" trajectories may\\nnot just lead to more
      professional fulfillment on the side of the\\nresearcher, but may also have
      unexpected benefits for society (e.g.,\\nwhen academics engage or contribute
      to industry, social organizations,\\nor government). The narrative CV in principle
      allows for showcasing\\ndiverse trajectories through academic research, for
      example in the sense\\nof creating room to document experience working in other
      fields,\\nprofessions, or experimenting with novel methods.\\n\\nA final important
      concern is of course the time required to craft and\\nevaluate narratives, which
      will often be significant. One way of\\nreducing this work is to aim for a degree
      of harmonization of formats\\nacross organizations. Led by the Royal Society,
      efforts to achieve this\\n[are already\\nunderway](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/research-culture/tools-for-support/resume-for-researchers/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      the UK. A related risk is that narrative CVs could turn into a new\\nbusiness
      opportunity for hired consultants, specialized in crafting\\ncatchy narratives.
      The attempt to \\\"optimize\\\" narrative CVs for\\nparticular funding opportunities
      through such professional support would\\nseem to undermine the intention of
      using new formats to increase the\\ninformational value of CVs, and of course
      it would raise questions about\\nwho has or does not have access to the necessary
      resources for such\\nsupport. Time will tell how researchers will adapt to narrative
      CV\\nformats, and it may be that a critical assessment or change of direction\\nwill
      be required in a few years' time.\\n\\n<figure style=\\\"float:right; margin-left:24px;\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/3bjorn2_300x300.jpg\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"18292\\\"

      A holistic perspective is needed\\n\\nAs this reflection on some of the key
      themes that came up during the\\nworkshop shows, there are lots of opportunities
      but also uncertainties\\nrelated to the recent wave of narrative CV initiatives.
      What is perhaps\\nmost interesting about it is that the current moment stimulates\\nreflection
      on practices of research assessment that are usually taken\\nfor granted. We
      might say that experiments with novel CV formats\\nfunction as a sort of sociological
      breaching experiment, where the\\nfundamentals of our conventional mechanisms
      for distributing science\\nfunding and academic hiring are put up for discussion.
      The breadth of\\nthe questions we raise in this short essay in any case prompts
      us to\\navoid thinking of the introduction of new CV formats as a panacea. CV\\nformats
      are just one element - albeit a particularly important one - in\\na broader
      set of practices of research assessment. Addressing the\\nfoundational problems
      that narrative CV formats are meant to solve will\\nrequire an empirically and
      conceptually well-understood view of the\\nself-reproduction of the scientific
      career system - both in terms of how\\nresearchers plan their careers and present
      themselves strategically for\\nassessment purposes, and in terms of the practical
      functioning of\\nresearch evaluation, as well as the science system as a whole.\\n\\n[[**

      an agenda gaining attention\\ntoday. The blog post gives an introduction to
      RRA and discusses how to\\nnavigate RRA guidelines, which can be a complex task.\\n\\n###
      What is Responsible Research Assessment (RRA)?\\n\\nA search for definitions
      of RRA resulted in:\\n\\n- [\\\\\\\"Responsible metrics as a way of framing
      appropriate uses of\\n  quantitative indicators in the governance, management
      and assessment\\n  of\\n  research\\\\\\\"](https://www.ukri.org/publications/review-of-metrics-in-research-assessment-and-management/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n-
      [\\\\\\\"Responsible research evaluation focuses on producing research\\n  metrics
      that adhere to certain principles, such as data accuracy,\\n  transparent data
      collection and analysis or making use of a diversity\\n  of\\n  indicators.\\\\\\\"](http://services.igi-global.com/resolvedoi/resolve.aspx?doi=10.4018/978-1-7998-2181-6.ch003){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n-
      RRA [\\\\\\\"is an umbrella term for approaches to assessment which\\n  incentivise,
      reflect and reward the plural characteristics of\\n  high-quality research,
      in support of diverse and inclusive research\\n  cultures.\\\\\\\"](https://rori.figshare.com/articles/report/The_changing_role_of_funders_in_responsible_research_assessment_progress_obstacles_and_the_way_ahead/13227914){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nTwo
      definitions focus on principles for working with metrics, and the\\nthird on
      supporting diverse and inclusive research culture through\\nresearch assessment.
      All are valid, and one unifying definition is still\\nlacking. Also, the terminology
      varies. Assessment and evaluation or\\nmetrics and indicators are used interchangeably.\\n\\nIt
      can be difficult to pinpoint exactly what RRA is and getting an\\noverview of
      RRA is equally complex. One approach, however, is RRA\\nguidelines that explain
      RRA and guide its implementation. Some\\ninternationally well-known RRA guidelines
      are: [San Francisco\\nDeclaration on Research Assessment\\n(DORA)](https://sfdora.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      [Leiden\\nManifesto](https://doi.org/10.1038/520429a){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      [Hong Kong\\nPrinciples](https://www.wcrif.org/guidance/hong-kong-principles){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nand\\n[SCOPE](https://inorms.net/scope-framework-for-research-evaluation/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nA
      common starting point for RRA and its guidelines is that traditional\\nquantitative
      research assessment and its emphasis on bibliometric\\nindicators may be easy
      to apply but has many biases. Criticism of\\ntraditional indicators is seen,
      for example, in DORA leading to the\\nrecommendation not to use Journal Impact
      Factors for research funding,\\nappointment, and promotion considerations.\\n\\nTraditional
      quantitative research assessment is indicator- or\\ndata-driven, meaning that
      popular indicators---for example the Journal\\nImpact Factor---or easily available
      data are the staring points of\\nassessments. Instead, RRA focuses on the entity
      to be assessed and\\nstarts with what seems to be lacking in the traditional
      quantitative\\nresearch assessments, for example, the values (cf. SCOPE), or
      the\\nresearch integrity (cf. Hong Kong Principles) of the entity to be\\nassessed.\\n\\n###
      Who use RRA guidelines?\\n\\nUniversities' adoption of RRA guidelines is relatively
      new, and [many\\nuniversities use DORA or Leiden Manifesto, sometimes to develop
      local\\nRRA\\npolicies](https://thebibliomagician.wordpress.com/2022/08/04/results-from-the-2021-responsible-metrics-state-of-the-art-survey/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nIt
      is possible to endorse DORA and Hong Kong Principles at their\\nwebsites, and
      the long lists of signatories show that not only\\nuniversities but also other
      institutions from the research sector\\nsupport RRA, for example, funders, publishers,
      learned societies,\\ngovernmental agencies, etc. Also, individuals are among
      the signatories.\\n\\nRRA guidelines are not only relevant at the individual,
      local, and\\nnational level. The European Commission has published an agreement
      on\\nhow to reform research assessment. [The RRA guidelines contribute to the\\nbasis
      for the reform, and the guidelines are among the tools for the\\npractical implementation
      of the\\nreform](https://coara.eu/app/uploads/2022/09/2022_07_19_rra_agreement_final.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\n###
      What are the scopes of RRA guidelines?\\n\\nFor institutions or individuals
      new to RRA, it can be difficult to\\nnavigate the guidelines. Which guidelines
      are relevant? What are the\\nscopes of the guidelines? How are the guidelines
      applied? Etc.\\n\\nTo answer these questions, [the Evaluation Checklists Project
      Charter\\nand its Criteria for Evaluation\\nChecklists](https://wmich.edu/sites/default/files/attachments/u350/2019/EvalChecklistsProject-Charter.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nis
      useful. The criteria are developed by experts from evaluation\\nresearch with
      the mission to \\\"advance excellence in evaluation by\\nproviding high-quality
      checklists to guide practice\\\" and the vision \\\"for\\nall evaluators to
      have the information they need to provide exceptional\\nevaluation service and
      advance the public good\\\".\\n\\nUsing the criteria *RRA guideline addresses
      one or more specific\\nevaluation tasks* and *RRA guideline clarifies or simplifies
      complex\\ncontent to guide performance of evaluation tasks*, it becomes apparent\\nthat
      the four guidelines mentioned earlier differ in their scopes: SCOPE\\naims to
      improve the assessment process, Hong Kong Principles wants to\\nstrengthen research
      integrity, Leiden Manifesto stresses accountability\\nin metrics-based research
      assessment, and DORA focuses on assessment of\\nresearch publications but also
      other types of output. (See also [this\\nposter from the Nordic Workshop on
      Bibliometrics and Research\\nPolicy](https://pure.itu.dk/ws/files/87075445/Poster_NW2022_Bruun_Gauffriau.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\n\\n###
      How easy are RRA guidelines to use?\\n\\nAbove it is shown that the first criteria
      can help understand the scope\\nof a RRA guideline. Whether a guideline is easy
      to use may be addressed\\nby the next sections of Criteria for Evaluation Checklists:
      *Clarity of\\nPurpose*, *Completeness and Relevance*, *Organization*, *Clarity
      of\\nWriting*, and *References and Sources*.\\n\\nEspecially, the criteria on
      *Clarity of Purpose* address how to use a\\nchecklist. Not all four RRA guidelines
      discussed here are clear on all\\nof these criteria, i.e., the process of applying
      the guidelines instead\\nof simply the result of using the guidelines. Here
      are some examples of\\nhow to meet these criteria and, thus, help the user applying
      the\\nguideline:\\n\\nSCOPE discusses the criterion *The circumstances in which
      it \\\\[the\\nguideline\\\\] should be used* and concludes that research assessment
      and,\\nthus, the use of SCOPE is not always the right solution. Assessment is\\nnot
      recommended to incentivize specific behaviours. For example, open\\naccess publishing
      would benefit more from making it easy for a\\nresearcher to comply than from
      measuring the researcher's share of open\\naccess publications.\\n\\nDORA addresses
      the criterion *Intended users*. The sections in the\\nguideline mention intended
      users. The users are funding agencies,\\nresearch institutions, publishers,
      organizations that supply metrics,\\nand researchers.\\n\\nLeiden Manifesto
      and Hong Kong Principles, respectively, have relatively\\nclear purposes because
      of their delimited scopes; accountability in\\nmetrics-based research assessment
      and strengthen research integrity.\\n\\nThe criteria sections *Completeness
      and Relevance*, *Organization*,\\n*Clarity of Writing*, and *References and
      Sources* further review how\\nwell a guideline supports the RRA process. For
      example, the four\\nguidelines provide illustrative examples and cases, but
      all aspects of\\nan assessment task are not necessarily covered. And the guidelines
      are\\norganized in sections, but it is not always clear how this organization\\nsupports
      the RRA process.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nRRA does not have a clear definition,
      and RRA guidelines can be\\ndifficult to apply. The Criteria for Evaluation
      Checklists provides a\\ntool developed by evaluation researchers that can help
      users choose\\nrelevant RRA guidelines for their work. Applying the understanding
      of\\nRRA guidelines constituted by the Evaluation Checklists Project Charter\\nmay
      also facilitate a systematic analysis of RRA guidelines that could\\nlead to
      a clearer definition of RRA.\\n\\n### ~Acknowledgements~\\n\\n~This work was

      conference (STI\\n2023)](https://sti2023.org){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}, we therefore
      introduce two\\nopen science experiments: We adopt a new publication and peer
      review\\nprocess, fully aligned with state-of-the-art open science practices,

      and peer review process\\n\\nIn earlier editions of the STI conference, contributions
      submitted to\\nthe conference were reviewed in a traditional closed peer review\\nprocess.
      Contributions accepted for presentation at the conference were\\npublished in
      the conference proceedings while those not accepted for\\npresentation were
      not published.\\n\\nFor the STI 2023 conference, we are going to experiment
      with an open\\n'publish, then review' model as an alternative to the closed
      'review,\\nthen publish' approach. The publication and peer review process will
      be\\norganized as follows:  \\n\\n- The conference will use a submission and
      publication platform provided\\n  by [Orvium](https://orvium.io/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      *All contributions\\n  submitted to the conference will immediately be published
      as a\\n  preprint on the platform.* Contributions will be openly accessible\\n
      \ under a CC-BY license. Authors will retain their copyright. Each\\n  contribution
      will have its own DOI.\\n\\n<!-- -->\\n\\n- The conference will organize an
      open peer review process. *For each\\n  contribution submitted to the conference,
      the reviews will be\\n  published on the Orvium platform and will be linked
      to the preprint\\n  version of the contribution.* Reviewers will be encouraged
      to disclose\\n  their identity, but they may also choose to remain anonymous.
      Authors\\n  will be invited to update their contribution based on the feedback\\n
      \ provided by reviewers. The updated contribution will also be published\\n
      \ on the Orvium platform.\\n\\n<!-- -->\\n\\n- As conference organizers, *we
      will use the peer review results to\\n  select contributions for presentation
      at the conference.* All\\n  contributions will remain available on the Orvium
      platform, both the\\n  contributions selected for presentation and those not
      selected.\\n\\nFurther information about the publication and peer review process
      of the\\nSTI 2023 conference can be found in the [call for\\npapers](https://www.sti2023.org/call-for-papers/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      The\\n'publish, then review' model that we are going to use at the conference\\nis

      \ \\n\\n**Expected benefits**\\n\\nCompared with the publication and peer review
      process in earlier\\neditions of the STI conference, we see a number of benefits
      in our new\\napproach:  \\n\\n- *Accelerating the dissemination of new scientific
      knowledge.* The\\n  immediate publication of conference contributions as preprints
      will\\n  speed up the dissemination of new scientific knowledge. Interested\\n
      \ researchers and practitioners will have access to the latest\\n  scientific
      findings without waiting for the conference to take place.\\n\\n<!-- -->\\n\\n-
      *Increasing the value of peer review.* In the traditional closed peer\\n  review
      model used in earlier editions of the STI conference, reviews\\n  were made
      available only to the authors of a conference contribution\\n  and to the conference
      organizers. In our new open peer review model,\\n  reviews will also be made
      available to the readers of a conference\\n  contribution, helping readers to
      develop a more informed understanding\\n  of the strengths and weaknesses of
      a contribution, also the ones not\\n  selected for presentation. This will increase
      the value of the\\n  reviews.\\n\\n<!-- -->\\n\\n- *Giving more recognition
      to authors.* The immediate publication of\\n  conference contributions as preprints
      will enable authors to get\\n  feedback and credit more rapidly.\\n\\n<!-- -->\\n\\n-
      *Giving more recognition to reviewers.* In the traditional closed peer\\n  review
      model used in earlier editions of the STI conference, reviewers\\n  hardly got
      any credit for their work. In our new open peer review\\n  model, reviewers
      who choose to disclose their identity will get public\\n  recognition.\\n\\n**Potential
      concerns**\\n\\nWe recognize that the publication and peer review process of
      the STI\\n2023 conference may also raise concerns. A common objection against\\npreprinting
      is that preprints may present inaccurate results because\\nthey are published
      before peer review. While results presented in\\npreprints may indeed be inaccurate,
      the same applies to results reported\\nin peer-reviewed articles, since peer
      review usually does not resolve\\nall inaccuracies in an article. We also note
      that the reviews that will\\nbe published alongside the preprinted conference
      contributions will help\\nreaders to assess the quality of a contribution. Another
      concern about\\npreprinting is that journals might be reluctant to publish articles
      that\\nhave already been published as a preprint. However, very few journals\\nstill
      have such a policy.\\n\\nA common concern about open peer review is that criticism
      provided by\\nreviewers may be incorrect or even offensive. As conference organizers,\\nwe
      call on reviewers to give constructive and respectful feedback, for\\ninstance
      by following the [FAST (focused, appropriate, specific,\\ntransparent)\\nprinciples](https://asapbio.org/fast-principles-for-preprint-feedback){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nWe
      reserve the right to moderate reviews that we regard as\\ndisrespectful. If
      the authors of a conference contribution consider\\ncriticism provided by a
      reviewer to be incorrect, they will have the\\npossibility to publish a response
      in which they explain why they\\ndisagree with the reviewer. Authors will also
      be able to update their\\nconference contribution to address problems identified
      by reviewers.\\n\\nWe appreciate that special consideration needs to be given
      to the\\ninterests of PhD students and other researchers who find themselves
      in\\nvulnerable positions. These researchers may be disproportionately\\naffected
      by the drawbacks of the way publication and peer review\\nprocesses are organized.
      In a closed 'review, then publish' model, peer\\nreview may be biased against
      these researchers, lowering their chances\\nof getting their work published.
      In an open 'publish, then review'\\nmodel, these researchers may feel uncomfortable
      both about their own\\nwork being critiqued publicly and about publicly critiquing
      the work of\\nothers, in particular the work of more senior colleagues. In the\\nevaluation
      of our new approach to publication and peer review (see\\nbelow), we will pay
      special attention to the experiences of PhD students\\nand other researchers
      in vulnerable positions.\\n\\n### Experiment 2: Reflecting on open science practices\\n\\nAs
      organizers of the STI 2023 conference, we strongly encourage authors\\nof contributions
      submitted to the conference to adopt open science\\npractices in their work.
      At the same time, we recognize that there may\\nbe barriers to the adoption
      of such practices, including for instance\\nreliance on proprietary data sources,
      legal or ethical concerns, and\\nlack of experience with open science practices.
      Rather than introducing\\nformal open science requirements, we therefore take
      a more experimental\\napproach. We invite authors of conference contributions
      to explicitly\\nreflect on their own open science practices.\\n\\n*Each contribution
      submitted to the conference is expected to include a\\nshort section in which
      the authors reflect on the use of open science\\npractices in the research presented
      in their contribution.*Authors may\\nfor instance discuss the openness of the
      data used in their research. If\\nthe data is openly available, the authors
      can explain how the data can\\nbe obtained. If the data is not openly available,
      the authors can\\nexplain why they do not use openly available data or why they
      are unable\\nto make their data openly available. Openness of software and source\\ncodes
      can be discussed in a similar way. Authors may also discuss\\nwhether a research
      plan was made openly available at the start of their\\nresearch ('preregistration')
      or whether any intermediate results of the\\nresearch have already been published,
      for instance in a preprint.\\n\\nWe hope this experiment will increase the awareness
      and adoption of open\\nscience practices in the science studies community. In
      addition, the\\nexperiment may also help organizers of future conferences to
      better\\nunderstand how the adoption of open science practices can be facilitated\\nand
      promoted.  \\n\\n### Evaluating the experiments\\n\\nThe above two experiments
      will hopefully provide an additional\\nmotivation to colleagues in the science
      studies community to submit\\ntheir work to our conference. We are eager to
      see how the experiments\\nwill work out. After the conference, we will invite
      conference\\nparticipants to fill in a survey to evaluate the experiments. The\\noutcomes
      of the evaluation will be reported in a blog post. In the\\nmeantime, if you
      have any questions about the experiments, or any\\nfeedback you would like to
      share, don't hesitate to [contact\\nus](mailto:sti2023@cwts.leidenuniv.nl).\\n\\nLooking
      forward to meeting you at STI 2023!  \\n\",\"published_at\":1676464200,\"updated_at\":1737279956,\"registered_at\":0,\"indexed_at\":1731078596,\"authors\":[{\"name\":
