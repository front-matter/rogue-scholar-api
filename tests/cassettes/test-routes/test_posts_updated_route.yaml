      are in peril. Human actions both\\nthreaten and promise to save the ocean, but
      how do technoscientific\\nenterprises contribute to transforming human-ocean
      relations? We invite\\ncontributions which explore the more-than-human, technoscientific

      organized by Mayline Strouk (STIS, University of Edinburgh and CWTS)\\nwith
      Bronte Evans Rayward (SPRI, University of Cambridge) and Oscar\\nHartman Davies
      (University of Oxford). The Open Panel aims to gather\\ncase studies and discussions
      on seabirds to engage with contemporary\\nurgent matters such as environmental
      change and the Anthropocene. We\\nseek to engage with STS topics such as technological
      developments,\\nmultispecies and more-than-human studies, and space and its\\nmaterialities.
      We welcome contributions focused on seabirds or where\\nseabirds play an intriguing
      role in addressing socio-technical matters.\\nWhat can seabirds teach us?\\n\\nPanel
      number 074 explores [*The limits of Open Research: critical views\\nand new\\nperspectives*](https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14113){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      is organized by Ismael Rafols and Louise Bezuidenhout. This open\\npanel critically
      examines the Open Science (OS) movement and the\\nenactment of its core values
      of equity, fairness, and inclusiveness. As\\nthe OS infrastructural landscape
      evolves, there is an underlying\\nassumption that these values will support
      the evolution of an equitable\\ndigital commons and, in consequence, equitable
      science. Nonetheless,\\nsimply assuming that these values are embedded in infrastructural
      design\\ncan be viewed as problematic. These open panels will critically engage\\nwith
      the dissonance between OS expectations and current enactment,\\nraising questions
      relating to limits of openness, meaningful\\nconnectivity and digital democratisation.\\n\\nPanel

      the recent proliferation of science reform movements,\\nincluding open science,
      meta-science, responsible research and\\ninnovation, responsible metrics, and
      research ssessment reform. These\\n'upstream' reform movements seek to address
      what campaigners consider\\ndeclining standards of quality or propriety around
      academic knowledge\\nproduction, communication and evaluation within their own

      organized by Francesco Colona, Sarah Rose Bieszczad and Judit Varga.\\nThe Panel
      explores the ocean as an object of study and concern\_in\\nvarious knowledge
      and artistic practices. It queries how oceanic futures\\nare entangled with
      hope and loss and how these futures intersect with\\nsocio-political, scientific,
      economic, industrial, and ecological\\nprocesses. This panel welcomes traditional
      presentations and artistic\\ncontributions (e.g. performances, films, or spoken
      words), and invites\\ninterventions about the ocean as an object of study and
      an object of\\nconcern.  \\n\\nPanel number 299 aims to bring together studies
      of [*new notions of\\nresearch\\nquality*](https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14378){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}*.*\\nVarious
      reform movements and science policy interventions have been\\nadding new elements
      to conceptions of quality in research-performing\\norganisations. Co-convened
      by Marta Sienkiewicz, Tjitske Holtrop and\\nThed van Leeuwen from CWTS, the
      panel invites contributions bringing an\\nSTS lens to the study of new quality
      notions, the reform movements that\\nsupport them and the evaluative situations
      where they count. We seek to\\ngenerate reflections of theoretical and practical
      significance for\\n(e)valuation, standardisation and justification of quality
      in research\\nassessments. The panel will combine academic presentations with
      an\\ninteractive workshop.\\n\\nPanel number 328, entitled [*Excavating fossilized
      data: Problematizing\\nties between academic research and polluting\\nindustries*](https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14411){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nis

      former colleague Guus Dix (UTwente), as well as Shivant Jhagroe and\\nDominika
      Czerniawska from other faculties of Leiden University. In this\\npanel, we want
      to explore experimental ways for STS to engage with the\\n\\\"cut the ties\\\"
      debate around campuses worldwide. We aim to host a\\nmethodologically diverse
      gathering in which we can collectively\\n'excavate' data and address pivotal
      political-epistemic effects of ties\\nbetween extractivist polluting industries
      and academic research in times\\nof climate crisis.\\n\\nPanel 340 develops
      the notion of [*More-than human research and\\nInnovation*](https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14424){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nIt
      is organized by Thomas Franssen (CWTS), Rob Smith (University of\\nEdinburgh)
      and Michael Bernstein (Austrian Institute of Technology). The\\npanel seeks
      to bring multispecies studies into onversation with STS\\nfocusing especially
      on the productive unruliness of mutlispecies\\ncollaboration. We seek to think
      about in/exclusion of other-than human\\nstakeholders and the conceptualization
      and realization of agency in\\necological restoration, sustainable agriculture,
      and other future\\necologies, as well as environmental science and governance,

      Chemical pollution is a main driver for global biodiversity\\nloss and the emissions
      of chemical industry contribute substantially to\\nclimate change. Regulation
      often falls short of adequately addressing\\nall negative impacts of novel chemicals.
      This session calls for papers\\naddressing the opportunities for and barriers
      to responsible innovation\\nin academic and industrial chemistry. How is knowledge
      produced and what\\nstandards determine the validity of knowledge? How do institutional\\nframeworks
      impact safety and responsibility allocation in the chemical\\nsector? What is
      the responsibility of academic researchers collaborating\\nwith industry?\\n\\nThe

      for\\ninstance in attributing publications to universities. In response to the\\nShanghai
      Ranking, CWTS decided to launch the [Leiden\\nRanking](https://www.leidenranking.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      aiming to\\ndemonstrate more appropriate ways to use bibliometric data for comparing\\nuniversities.
      While the Leiden Ranking did not gain the same visibility\\nas the Shanghai,
      THE, and QS rankings, it developed a strong reputation\\nfor offering a robust,
      high-quality approach for comparing universities\\nin terms of bibliometric
      parameters.\\n\\nToday, after almost two decades, the Leiden Ranking is going
      to take an\\nambitious next step in improving bibliometric approaches for comparing\\nuniversities.
      The [Open Edition of the Leiden\\nRanking](https://open.leidenranking.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      launched\\ntoday by CWTS, addresses one of the most challenging problems of\\nbibliometric
      indicators: the lack of transparency of these indicators\\ndue to their dependence
      on proprietary data. Together with the [Curtin\\nOpen Knowledge Initiative\\n(COKI)](https://openknowledge.community/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      [Sesame Open\\nScience](https://bmkramer.github.io/SesameOpenScience_site/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nand
      [OurResearch](https://ourresearch.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}, CWTS has\\nrebuilt
      the Leiden Ranking, making it fully transparent by working\\nexclusively with
      open data and open source algorithms. Until now, the\\nLeiden Ranking has always
      been based on data from [Web of\\nScience](https://webofscience.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      a proprietary data\\nsource owned by Clarivate. The Leiden Ranking Open Edition
      uses data\\nfrom [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}, a
      fully open\\ndata source created by OurResearch. To the best of our knowledge,
      the\\nLeiden Ranking Open Edition is the first fully transparent university\\nranking.\\n\\nThe
      importance of transparency of university rankings is widely\\nrecognized. CWTS
      emphasizes the need to be transparent in [its ten rules\\nfor ranking\\nuniversities](https://www.researchresearch.com/news/article/?articleId=1368350){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nTransparency
      also features prominently in the [criteria for fair and\\nresponsible university\\nrankings](https://inorms.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/principles-for-fair-and-responsible-university-assessment-v5.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\ndeveloped
      by the International Network of Research Management Societies\\n(INORMS). These
      criteria were used in the [rethinking the rankings\\ninitiative](https://arma.ac.uk/rethinking-the-rankings/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nLikewise,
      transparency and openness are key elements in the [strategy\\nfor culture change
      regarding university\\nrankings](https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/en/ranking-the-university){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nthat
      is currently being implemented in the Netherlands. More in general,\\nthe [UNESCO
      Recommendation on Open\\nScience](https://doi.org/10.54677/MNMH8546){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      highlights\\nthe need for \\\"open bibliometrics and scientometrics systems\\\".
      In a\\nsimilar vein, the [Agreement on Reforming Research\\nAssessment](https://coara.eu/agreement/the-agreement-full-text/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nstresses
      the importance of \\\"independence and transparency of the data,\\ninfrastructure
      and criteria necessary for research assessment\\\".\\n\\n### **How did we create
      the Leiden Ranking Open Edition?**\\n\\nThe Leiden Ranking Open Edition aims
      to reproduce the traditional Leiden\\nRanking as closely as possible, focusing
      on the [Leiden Ranking\\n2023](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-cwts-leiden-ranking-2023){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nthat
      was published in June last year. The Open Edition includes the same\\n1411 universities
      that are also included in the Leiden Ranking 2023.\\nInstead of proprietary
      data from Web of Science, the Open Edition uses\\nopen data from OpenAlex. This
      data is harvested by OpenAlex from a\\n[variety of\\nsources](https://help.openalex.org/how-it-works/entities-overview){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nincluding
      [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\n[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      and the\\nwebsites of publishers. The Open Edition is based on the [OpenAlex\\nsnapshot](https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/openalex-snapshot){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nreleased
      on November 21, 2023.\\n\\nFigure 1 summarizes the process of creating the Leiden

      \ \\n**Core publications**\\n\\nWeb of Science and OpenAlex differ in their
      coverage of the scientific\\nliterature. Most publications covered by Web of
      Science are also covered\\nby OpenAlex, but OpenAlex covers many publications
      that Web of Science\\ndoes not cover. The traditional Leiden Ranking focuses
      on so-called core\\npublications, which are identified based on a [number of\\ncriteria](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThe
      Open Edition also has a focus on core publications, identified based\\non [similar\\ncriteria](https://open.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nHowever,
      because of coverage differences between Web of Science and\\nOpenAlex, the set
      of core publications considered in the Open Edition\\ndiffers from the set of
      core publications considered in the traditional\\nLeiden Ranking. This is discussed
      in more detail in [this blog\\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/opening-up-the-cwts-leiden-ranking-toward-a-decentralized-and-open-model-for-data-curation){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\n**Publication
      classification**\\n\\nThe Leiden Ranking relies on a detailed algorithmic classification
      of\\npublications into research areas. This classification is used to assign\\npublications
      to main fields and to calculate normalized citation impact\\nindicators. For
      the Open Edition, CWTS created a new classification of\\npublications based
      on OpenAlex data. [This blog\\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/an-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nprovides
      more details.\\n\\n**CWTS organization registry**\\n\\nOpenAlex uses [ROR (Research
      Organization Registry)\\nidentifiers](https://ror.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      for organizations, while\\nthe Leiden Ranking has traditionally used internal
      CWTS organization\\nidentifiers. For the Open Edition, CWTS created a new organization\\nregistry
      by matching CWTS organization identifiers to ROR identifiers.\\nThis was done
      for the 1411 universities included in the Open Edition and\\nfor the [affiliated
      organizations linked to these\\nuniversities](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/a-team-a-stands-for-very-challenging-job){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nAdditional
      links between universities and affiliated organizations were\\nobtained from
      the ROR organization registry. Links between universities\\nand their affiliated
      organizations are presented in a transparent way on\\nthe website of the Open
      Edition (see Figure 2).  \\n\\n<figure style=\\\"text-align:center;\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/VjpSp7dpbdBJKP1aRBdINJ4IzoRdB0W9i1Nyb8ZTbyiT_avm6-892DopQpVUKpwoInEXPBI-NVW7rrW9y-5yKLSlIpv7S68l6xfrYUn87rwcPpM0oHcsi8IeWgyjFEUO5H8UqirPzjgMqpbF4Pcec9A\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"uwb2iwqsd0wv\\\"

      \ \\nPublication-university links**\\n\\nOpenAlex provides ROR identifiers for
      the affiliations of authors of\\npublications. We linked publications to universities
      by connecting ROR\\nidentifiers obtained from OpenAlex to the ROR identifiers
      of\\nuniversities and their affiliated organizations in the CWTS organization\\nregistry.
      In [this blog\\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/opening-up-the-cwts-leiden-ranking-toward-a-decentralized-and-open-model-for-data-curation){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nthe
      CWTS team presents a comparison between the approach for linking\\npublications
      to universities used in the traditional Leiden Ranking and\\nthe approach used
      in the Open Edition.\\n\\n**Indicators**\\n\\nThe Open Edition includes the
      same bibliometric indicators as the\\ntraditional Leiden Ranking, except for
      [indicators of gender\\ndiversity](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#gender-indicators){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThese
      indicators are somewhat more challenging to produce using OpenAlex\\ndata because
      OpenAlex does not make a distinction between first and last\\nnames of authors.
      This distinction is important for algorithmic gender\\ninference. At the moment
      gender diversity indicators are therefore not\\nincluded in the Open Edition.
      We may add them in the future.\\n\\n### **How to access the data and software**\\n\\nThe
      data used to create the Leiden Ranking Open Edition is [openly\\navailable in\\nZenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10579113){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      under\\na [CC0 public domain\\ndedication](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThe
      data can also be [accessed through Google\\nBigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?ws=!1m4!1m3!3m2!1scwts-leiden!2sleiden_ranking_open_edition_2023){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n(to
      run queries you need to have a BigQuery account and your own\\nproject). Universities
      may for instance use the data to check whether\\npublications have been correctly
      attributed to them. Performing such\\nchecks is not possible in the case of
      the traditional Leiden Ranking,\\nsince this ranking is based on proprietary
      data that cannot be shared\\nopenly.\\n\\nThe source code of the software used
      to create the Leiden Ranking Open\\nEdition is [openly available in\\nGitHub](https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/CWTS-Leiden-Ranking-Open-Edition){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nunder
      an MIT license. A Microsoft SQL Server database system was used to\\nperform
      the data processing and the calculations. The source code\\ntherefore consists
      mostly of SQL scripts.**  \\n**\\n\\n### **How to compare the Open Edition with
      the traditional Leiden Ranking**\\n\\nTo what extent does the Open Edition provide
      results that are similar to\\nthose provided by the traditional Leiden Ranking?
      To address this\\nquestion, we have created an [interactive\\ndashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiODg0YWM2MzEtMmVlNS00NzEyLWE2YjMtMTIxM2Y3ZjMxYTJkIiwidCI6ImNhMmE3Zjc2LWRiZDctNGVjMC05MTA4LTZiM2Q1MjRmYjdjOCIsImMiOjh9){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      which the values of the indicators in the two editions of the Leiden\\nRanking
      can be easily compared.\\n\\nThe interactive dashboard can for instance be used
      to explore the\\ncorrelation between the number of publications of a university
      in the\\ntraditional Leiden Ranking and in the Open Edition (see Figure 3),
      or\\nthe correlation between a university's proportion of highly cited\\npublications
      in the two editions of the Leiden Ranking (see Figure 4).  \\n  \\n\\n<figure

      \ \\n\\nIn general, we consider the correlations between indicator values in
      the\\ntwo editions of the Leiden Ranking to be quite strong. However, for some\\nuniversities
      there are large differences between the two editions of the\\nLeiden Ranking.
      In many cases this is probably due to differences in the\\npublications attributed
      to a university. This issue is analyzed in more\\ndetail in [this blog\\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/opening-up-the-cwts-leiden-ranking-toward-a-decentralized-and-open-model-for-data-curation){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\n###
      **What is next?**\\n\\nAt the moment the Leiden Ranking Open Edition is still
      of an\\nexperimental nature. Building the ranking was an incredibly useful\\nexercise
      for our organizations (CWTS, COKI, Sesame Open Science, and\\nOurResearch).
      We also expect to learn a lot from the feedback we hope to\\nreceive from users
      of the Open Edition. Based on the lessons learned, we\\nwill make further improvements
      to the Open Edition. Within one or two\\nyears, we expect the Open Edition to
      be fully mature and to offer a full\\nreplacement for the traditional Leiden
      Ranking.\\n\\nWhile our organisations are making further improvements to the
      Leiden\\nRanking Open Edition, CWTS will continue to release annual updates
      of\\nthe traditional Leiden Ranking based on Web of Science data. In the next\\none
      or two years, we expect the traditional Leiden Ranking and the Open\\nEdition
      to co-exist. In the somewhat longer term, CWTS will make a [full\\ntransition
      to open research\\ninformation](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/toward-open-research-information-introducing-the-information-openness-focal-area-at-cwts){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nWithin
      the next few years, all bibliometric indicators produced by CWTS,\\nincluding
      those in the Leiden Ranking, will be based on open data.\\n\\nThe transition
      of the Leiden Ranking toward open data fits into broader\\ndiscussions about
      openness of research information, responsible use of\\nbibliometric indicators,
      and reform of research assessment. Critical\\nreflection on the value of university
      rankings should be part of these\\nimportant discussions.  \\n\\n### **How to

      the start of this year to organise our activities. Here, we introduce\\nthe
      vision and roadmap of the Focal Area Engagement & Inclusion.\\n\\n### Our vision\\n\\nIn
      today\\\\'s rapidly changing world, fostering a collaborative, diverse\\nand
      inclusive science ecosystem that engages with society is of\\nparamount importance.
      As we navigate complex global challenges such as\\nclimate change, pandemics,
      and artificial intelligence, it becomes\\nevident that diverse perspectives,
      inclusive participation and public\\nengagement in scientific knowledge creation
      and communication are key to\\nunlocking science-based solutions for societal
      challenges. The Focal\\nArea Engagement & Inclusion *envisions studying and
      promoting diversity\\nand inclusivity in the science ecosystem and the engagement
      and\\ncommunication between science and society.*\\n\\nIn line with the three
      pillars of the CWTS knowledge agenda --\\n*understanding*, *intervening* and
      *practising* -- we developed an\\nambitious agenda for the study and promotion
      of diversity, inclusion,\\nengagement, communication and science-society interactions.
      Our work\\nwill not only contribute to research and teaching around these\\nquestions,
      but will also support policy developments and interventions,\\nand generate
      insights into how we can implement our findings at our own\\ncentre.\\n\\n###
      Representation & Inclusiveness {#representation-inclusiveness}\\n\\nWe believe
      diversity and inclusivity in the global science ecosystem is\\nimportant. By
      breaking down barriers to participation in science for\\nindividuals from a
      variety of backgrounds, cultures, and experiences, we\\nenrich the pool of knowledge,
      ideas, and approaches in research, which,\\nin turn, helps to address scientific
      and societal challenges more\\neffectively. Who gets to participate in science
      is not always\\nself-evident and requires more fundamental understanding and\\nwell-considered
      interventions to improve the inclusion and\\nrepresentation of all social groups
      in science, and the science system\\nas a whole.\\n\\n### Epistemic Diversity\\n\\nEpistemic
      diversity in the science system is of major importance. We\\nneed to recognise
      how different topics, research questions, knowledge\\nsystems, and actors, including\\n[other-than-human](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23299460.2021.1906040){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nones,
      help to produce a fairer and more nuanced understanding of complex\\nglobal
      issues. By monitoring and promoting epistemic diversity, we\\nexpect to foster
      a more inclusive and innovative environment where\\ndifferent ways of knowing
      are valued and incorporated.\\n\\nFor instance, we want to study and address
      the lack of\\n[coverage](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-coverage-matters-invisibility-of-agricultural-research-from-the-global-south-may-be-an-obstacle-to-development){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      mainstream scientometric databases; a problem that stands in the way\\nof making
      important societal topics visible in science policy.\\nConsequently, we expect
      to develop\\n[*multiversatories*](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\npolicies,
      and recommendations to support funders and science policy with\\nreinforcing
      epistemic diversity.\\n\\n### Engagement & Communication {#engagement-communication}\\n\\nA
      research system that is disconnected from society is essentially\\nineffective.
      Science communication, public engagement with science, and\\nparticipatory approaches
      for collaborative knowledge production are\\nintegral building blocks for a
      stronger and more relevant research and\\ninnovation ecosystem. Effective science
      communication and public\\nengagement help to bridge the gap between academia
      and society; help to\\nmake scientific approaches and knowledge more accessible
      to the wider\\npublic and societal stakeholders (e.g. policy makers, industry,
      etc.);\\nlimit the impact of misinformation and the misuse of scientific\\ninformation;
      and may help to increase public trust in science. We will\\nstudy how society
      engages with science, in order to improve science\\ncommunication and strengthen
      the role science can play in society.\\n\\n[Citizen\\nscience](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/dossiers/academia-in-motion/open-science/citizen-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      other participatory approaches can create a stronger sense of\\nsocietal ownership
      and accountability, turning scientific research into\\na collective societal
      endeavour. Societal actors outside academia\\ncontribute to the scientific ecosystem
      in various ways, for instance\\nwith local and traditional knowledge or insights
      from lived experience,\\nor by contributing to evidence-informed policy-making.
      The engagement of\\nsocietal actors can also direct the attention of research
      to issues of\\nsocietal importance, increasing both their societal relevance
      and their\\npractical impacts. Engaging other actors, such as industry,\\npolicy-makers
      or non-governmental organisations, can help with more\\ninformed policy, decision-making
      and innovation. We want to study\\ncitizen-science practices and how they are
      changing scientific outcomes,\\nwith the aim of helping to shape citizen-science
      further.\\n\\n### Accomplishing our ambitions\\n\\n####   {#section dir=\\\"ltr\\\"}\\n\\n####
      **Coordination of dreams, people, and projects** {#coordination-of-dreams-people-and-projects
      dir=\\\"ltr\\\"}\\n\\nThe real treasure trove of the Focal Area Engagement &
      Inclusion is all\\nthe individual members with their own areas of expertise,
      projects,\\n[dreams](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/dreaming-at-cwts){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nand
      activities. We are a team of more than 30 colleagues from a variety\\nof backgrounds
      and career stages.\\n\\nAs a first step, we mapped our research projects, PhD
      projects, and\\npersonal *dreams* into three sub-areas (which we initially characterised\\nas
      *ambitions*!), as well as into the existing contractual (i.e.,\\n[BV](https://www.cwtsbv.nl/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"})
      and [institute\\nprojects](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nand

      The roadmap {#the-roadmap dir=\\\"ltr\\\"}\\n\\nWe have created a working group
      for each of the three sub-areas to\\nbundle expertise and resources. The working
      groups will bring together a\\ndiverse range of colleagues, from within and
      outside of CWTS, each\\ncontributing with their unique knowledge to tackle the
      complex\\nchallenges of the sub-areas.\\n\\nProjects play a pivotal role in
      our day-to-day work at CWTS. Our Focal\\nArea will help coordinate existing
      projects, and monitor funding\\nopportunities to set up new projects. Our focused
      strategy of aligning\\nprojects with the goals of the Focal Area will be crucial
      for achieving\\nour vision and ambitions.\\n\\nIn addition, engagement and communication
      activities will be of central\\nimportance for the Focal Area. We think of [dedicated\\nseminars](https://www.cwts.nl/seminars/diversity-and-inclusion-in-global-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nspecial
      sessions at conferences (e.g. a special session on \\\"[Researching\\n(in-)

      was\\nnot only discussed at the conference but was also put into practice in\\nthe
      publication and peer review process of the conference. By way of\\n[experiment](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/experimenting-with-open-science-practices-at-the-sti-2023-conference){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nall
      papers submitted to the conference were published as a preprint\\nbefore they
      were peer reviewed. Moreover, the peer review process was\\nopen: Review reports
      were published alongside the preprinted papers, and\\nsome reviewers also chose
      to sign their reports.\\n\\nWhat did we learn from this experiment? To evaluate
      the experiment, we\\ninvited all 186 authors of conference submissions to complete
      a brief\\nanonymous survey ([survey\\nform](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s2LfQngGoy4IeVWy6lrl3VFdhDYgP8GI/view?usp=sharing){target=\\\"_blank\\\"};\\n[survey\\nresponses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lmwCIJvzhf3yPWIJnbr3sQz0gALeL5I7HkmUqh5PzFY/edit?usp=sharing){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\nSurvey
      invitations were sent after the conference. We received 93\\nresponses, corresponding
      to a response rate of 50%. Below we discuss the\\noutcomes of the survey.  \\n\\n###
      Preprinting\\n\\nWe first asked survey respondents to share their opinion about\\npreprinting
      of conference submissions. Preprinting of conference\\nsubmissions is strongly
      supported. 51% of the respondents selected the\\nhighest score (5), indicating
      they \\\\\\\"like it a lot\\\\\\\", and an additional\\n37% of the respondents
      selected the second-highest score (4). Only a\\nsmall minority of 6% of the
      respondents do not support preprinting and\\nselected the lowest (1; \\\\\\\"I
      don\\\\'t like it at all\\\\\\\") or second-lowest\\n(2) score.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_1.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"37790\\\"
      />\\n</figure>\\n\\n  \\nWhen asked what they see as advantages and disadvantages
      of preprinting\\nof conference submissions, respondents indicated they appreciate
      the\\nearly access and visibility of research through preprinting. The ability\\nto
      receive feedback and engage with peers is also seen as an advantage.\\nIn addition,
      preprinting enables researchers to establish priority on\\nemerging topics.
      However, concerns revolve around the quality assurance\\nof preprints, with
      worries that some submissions represent ongoing work\\nthat still needs further
      development, in which case preprinting may\\nundermine the credibility of the
      research. There is also a risk that\\nearly-career researchers may feel pressured
      by the open nature of\\npreprints.  \\n\\n### Open peer review\\n\\nSupport
      for open peer review is almost as strong as support for\\npreprinting. 73% of
      the survey respondents expressed support for open\\npeer review (score of 4
      or 5). Only 14% of the respondents were opposed\\nto open peer review (score
      of 1 or 2).\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_2.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"37805\\\"
      />\\n</figure>\\n\\n  \\nRespondents recognized several advantages of open peer
      review, including\\nenhanced transparency, constructive feedback, and accountability
      of\\nreviewers. However, respondents expressed concerns about variations in\\nreview
      quality and about the potential impact of negative reviews,\\nespecially on
      early-career researchers. Some respondents indicated a\\npreference for fully
      anonymous peer review, to make sure author\\nidentities do not influence reviewers.
      \ \\n\\n### Future editions of the STI conference\\n\\nSurvey respondents are
      very positive about the idea of adopting\\npreprinting and open peer review
      at future editions of the STI\\nconference. 76% of the respondents are in favor
      of this idea (score of 4\\nor 5), while only 7% oppose the idea (score of 1
      or 2).\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_3.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"37820\\\"
      />\\n</figure>\\n\\n  \\nRespondents also offered suggestions for improvement.
      They would value\\nmore thorough reviews, increased transparency in the decision-making\\nprocess,
      and well-defined evaluation criteria. Some respondents\\nrecommended improving
      the selection and assignment of reviewers. Several\\nrespondents felt there
      is a need to have a more user-friendly platform\\nfor publishing and reviewing
      conference submissions.  \\n\\n### Strengths and weaknesses of the Orvium platform\\n\\nThe
      opinions of survey respondents about the [Orvium\\nplatform](https://dapp.orvium.io/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      which was used to\\npublish and review conference submissions, are a bit more
      mixed. When\\nasked about their satisfaction with the platform, 66% of the respondents\\ngave
      a positive response (score 4 or 5). Only 8% gave a negative\\nresponse (score
      1 or 2), but there is also a significant share of the\\nrespondents (25%) that
      gave a neutral response (score of 3).\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_4.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"37843\\\"
      />\\n</figure>\\n\\n  \\nRespondents mentioned several strengths of the Orvium
      platform,\\nincluding the platform\\\\'s ability to issue DOIs, support for
      having\\nmultiple versions of a paper, and the generation of 'previews' of papers\\nfor
      convenient reading in a web browser. However, a number of weaknesses\\nwere
      also mentioned. While some respondents considered the platform easy\\nto use,
      others found that navigation was challenging and the interface\\nconfusing.
      Respondents also reported problems with the platform\\\\'s\\nsearch function.
      \ \\n\\n### Impact of the STI 2023 conference on open science perspectives\\n\\nWe
      also asked survey respondents whether the STI 2023 conference changed\\ntheir
      ideas about open science. Most respondents reported that their\\nviews on open
      science remained largely unchanged, as they were already\\nsupportive of open
      science. However, a significant share of the\\nrespondents found that the conference
      reinforced their positive views of\\nopen science. These respondents for instance
      mentioned that they\\nappreciate the practical implementation of open science
      at the\\nconference. At the same time, some respondents reported that the\\nconference
      made them more aware of potential drawbacks of open science,\\nsuch as information
      overload and problems in quality assurance\\nprocesses.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nBased
      on the outcomes of the survey, we consider the experiment with\\npreprinting
      and open peer review at the STI 2023 conference to be\\nsuccessful. While some
      survey respondents are critical, a large majority\\nof the respondents are positive
      about the experiment. Moreover, over\\nthree-quarters of the respondents recommend
      that future editions of the\\nSTI conference adopt preprinting and open peer
      review. The feedback\\nprovided by respondents offers excellent guidance for
      making further\\nimprovements to publication and peer review processes at the
      STI\\nconference, hopefully enabling the full potential of open science to be\\nrealized.\\n\\n*We

      in the heart of the Andes, where I find\\nmyself reflecting on two transformative
      events in my scientific journey:\\nthe CWTS Scientometrics Summer School (CS^3^)
      and the 27th International\\nConference on Science, Technology, and Innovation
      Indicators (STI 2023).\\nAs a bibliometrics enthusiast for the past two decades,
      this experience\\nhas been nothing short of a revelation---a journey that prompted
      me to\\nquestion the very fabric of scientific evaluation and metrics.\\n\\nTwo
      decades ago, my foray into bibliometrics was marked by conventional\\nsurvey
      field research. Fast forward ten years, and I realized the\\nuntapped potential
      of bibliometrics in advancing Library and Information\\nScience (LIS). My maiden
      bibliometric study delved into the\\ncontroversial realm of the h-index, assessing
      its utility in gauging the\\nscientific output of Peruvian researchers. The
      journey took a pivotal\\nturn in 2015 when I attended the \\\"Measuring Science
      and Research\\nPerformance\\\"\_course at CWTS in Leiden, a week that unraveled
      the\\nlimitations and detrimental consequences associated with relying on the\\nh-index
      for critical decisions like research grants or promotions.\\n\\nWhy the focus
      on the h-index? Because, like the widely contested journal\\nimpact factor,
      it stands as one of the most popular yet frequently\\nmisused bibliometric indicators.
      Over almost a decade of dedicated\\nbibliometric studies, I couldn\\\\'t ignore
      the grim reality in many South\\nAmerican countries---bibliometric reports often
      perpetuate the status\\nquo, hindering scientific progress. Indicators, meant
      to guide and\\ninform, had become perverse incentives. Researchers, chasing
      elusive\\ncitations, prioritized studies that fit into pre-existing frameworks\\nrather
      than addressing pressing regional and local needs.\\n\\nEven workshops advocating
      for open science, while championing\\ntransparency and accessibility, often
      fell short. Discussions on\\nalternative indicators typically revolve around
      metrics tied to\\ndownloads or citations from open information sources. While
      open-access\\npublishing dominates the discourse on open science practices,
      few\\nconsider the potential of data sharing and code transparency: for\\nexample,
      sharing bibliographic datasets or the R/Stata codes essential\\nfor transparent
      data analysis.  \\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/day-2-vevrvolg-11.jpg\\\"\\nalt=\\\"Day

      years after my inaugural visit to Leiden, I had the privilege of\\nreturning
      to participate in the\\n[CS3](https://www.cwts.nl/education/cwts-course-program/cwts-scientometrics-summer-school-2023){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      the [STI 2023](https://www.sti2023.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}. These\\nevents
      were crucibles of intellectual exchange, where I encountered a\\nwealth of perspectives
      that ignited new possibilities for my own\\nresearch journey. The incorporation
      of insights from the sociology of\\nscience and science and technology studies
      (STS) offered a refreshing\\nlens, challenging us to move beyond mere numbers
      and delve into the\\nsocial and cultural contexts that shape scientific knowledge
      production.\\nExploring diverse information sources, beyond the confines of\\nestablished
      databases, promised a more nuanced understanding of\\nscientific impact, particularly
      in regions often marginalized by\\ntraditional bibliometric approaches.\\n\\nBut
      most importantly, the shared experiences and diverse perspectives of\\ncolleagues
      from across the globe truly resonated. The STI 2023\\nconference brought together
      Global North and South voices, bridging the\\ngap between established research
      powerhouses and emerging scientific\\necosystems. Through open dialogue and
      critical reflection, we began to\\ndismantle the monolithic assumptions that
      often underpin bibliometric\\nanalysis. We acknowledged the distinct dynamics
      of scientific production\\nin different regions and the varying priorities and
      challenges faced by\\nresearchers in high-income and low-middle-income countries.\\n\\nThis
      newfound awareness, I believe, is the key to unlocking the true\\npotential
      of bibliometrics. By embracing diversity, incorporating\\ncritical perspectives,
      and forging connections across borders, we can\\ntransform this field from a
      passive observer into an active agent for\\npositive change. We can use bibliometrics
      not to reinforce existing\\ninequalities but to guide us toward a more inclusive
      and equitable\\nscientific landscape, one where research serves the needs of
      all,\\nregardless of their geographic location or economic standing.\\n\\nIn
      bidding farewell to the [Scientometrics Summer\\nSchool](https://www.cwts.nl/education/cwts-course-program/cwts-scientometrics-summer-school-2023){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      the [STI 2023\\nConference](https://www.sti2023.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      I can\\\\'t help\\nbut see it as not just an end but a promising new beginning.
      Armed with\\nenriched perspectives, I embark on the next chapter of my bibliometric\\njourney,
      eager to implement the lessons learned in contributing to a\\nmore equitable
      and impactful scientific landscape.  \\n\\n[  \\nHeader and in-text\_image:

      Although very visible during the COVID-19 pandemic, science\\nalso plays a large

      of the questions that guide our research line include: in societal\\ndebates,
      are different \\\"sides\\\" informed by different literatures,\\nperhaps reinforcing

      used in arguments?\\nHow do scientists themselves engage in such societal debates?\\n\\nIn
      addition to science, misinformation also plays a large role in\\nsocietal debates.
      During COVID-19, this prompted the World Health\\nOrganisation (WHO) to speak

      to help\\nprevent the spread of misinformation. But how does science interact
      with\\nmisinformation?\\n\\n### Science and misinformation\\n\\nWe are excited
      to start a new project on [Understanding Misinformation\\nand Science in Societal
      Debates\\n(UnMiSSeD)](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects/unmissed){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nIn
      this project, we will study the interaction between misinformation\\nand science
      during the COVID-19 pandemic using both quantitative and\\nqualitative approaches.
      Our quantitative analyses will be limited to\\nTwitter (now X), based on more
      than a billion tweets posted during the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic, combined with information
      on millions of publications\\nand tweets about them. We will go beyond Twitter
      in our qualitative\\nanalyses to explore how discussions permeate the porous
      boundaries of\\nsocial media. We will collaborate with Fondazione Bruno Kessler
      (FBK),\\nlead by [Riccardo\\nGallotti](https://chub.fbk.eu/team#h.4rhone98mox8){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      and\\nUniversity of Geneva, lead by [Tommaso\\nVenturini](http://www.tommasoventurini.it/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      We are\\nhappy that this project is supported by the [European Media and\\nInformation\\nFund](https://gulbenkian.pt/emifund/projects/understanding-misinformation-and-science-in-societal-debates-unmissed/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\n###
      New perspective\\n\\nAt CWTS, we already have previous experience with studying
      [connections\\nbetween science and\\nsociety](https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.24427){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      also in\\nthe context of\\n[COVID-19](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/delineating-covid-19-and-coronavirus-research-an-analysis-of-the-cord-19-dataset){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nWe
      also studied how COVID-19 appeared in [a media\\noutlet](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/exploring-the-covid-19-discourse-in-the-conversation){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nMuch
      of our knowledge on science in social media is based on data from\\n[Altmetric](https://www.altmetric.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      and provides a\\ngood lens on which aspects of academic publications relate
      to being\\nmentioned on (social) media. Previous projects at CWTS departed from\\nscience
      and explored where science was mentioned, referenced and taken\\nup. However,
      this approach misses the broader contexts in which science\\nis mentioned. Societal
      debates are multifaceted processes [where\\nscientific mentions are couched
      in and interact with other ways of\\nknowing the world](http://modesofexistence.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      In\\nthe UnMiSSeD project, our starting point are societal debates\\nthemselves.
      We explore when and how science becomes part of such\\ndebates, also in relation
      to misinformation and claims unrelated to\\nscience. In this way, we hope to
      better understand the role of science\\nand misinformation in societal debates.\\n\\nThis
      project brings together a novel combination of scientific fields at\\nCWTS.
      Traditionally, our centre is more focused on science (and\\ntechnology) studies.

      priorities for university Z? These are just a few examples\\nof the many important
      decisions that researchers, research evaluators,\\nand science policy makers
      need to make on a daily basis. Decisions like\\nthese are increasingly made
      in data-driven ways, guided by research\\nanalytics ranging from simple scientometric
      indicators and university\\nrankings to complex dashboards that bring together
      data from a variety\\nof sources.\\n\\n### The Information & Openness focal
      area {#the-information-openness-focal-area}\\n\\nLast year the Information &
      Openness focal area was established at CWTS.\\nIn this focal area we are concerned
      with the complex interplay between\\ndecision making processes in science, the
      information used in these\\nprocesses, and the nature of this information in
      terms of properties\\nsuch as openness, transparency, inclusiveness, and ownership.
      This\\ncomplex interplay is subject to ongoing disruption from two movements\\nwith
      global aspirations: open science and responsible research\\nassessment. Our
      work in the focal area builds on decades of experience\\nwe have at CWTS in
      using scientometric data to support research\\nassessment and strategic decision
      making in science. Having been at the\\nforefront of developments in scientometrics,
      we not only have a lot of\\nknowledge about scientometric data sources, indicators,
      and algorithms,\\nbut we also have a deep understanding of the role scientometrics
      plays\\nin all kinds of decision-making processes.\\n\\nBuilding on our experience
      and recognizing that decisions in science are\\nincreasingly being made in data-driven
      ways, the Information & Openness\\nfocal area aims to study and promote responsible
      approaches to the use\\nof data in decision making processes in science. We
      are interested in\\nthe properties of the data sources that are being used and
      how these\\nproperties contribute to, or impede, responsible ways of decision\\nmaking.
      The field of scientometrics has a long tradition of working with\\nproprietary
      data sources, especially Web of Science and Scopus. However,\\nthe closed nature
      of these data sources is increasingly seen as an\\nobstacle to transparent and
      responsible decision making, for instance in\\nthe context of research assessment.
      In the Information & Openness focal\\narea we are therefore particularly interested
      in studying and promoting\\nopenness of scientometric data, and of research
      information more\\ngenerally.\\n\\n### **Three pillars**\\n\\nIn line with the
      organization of the\_[broader knowledge agenda of\\nCWTS](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-focal-areas-of-cwts){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nour
      work in the Information & Openness focal area is organized in three\\npillars:
      understanding, intervening, and practicing. In the box below we\\noutline our
      plans for each of these pillars.\\n\\n<table>\\n<colgroup>\\n<col style=\\\"width:
      100%\\\" />\\n</colgroup>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr class=\\\"odd\\\">\\n<td><p><strong>Understanding</strong></p>\\n<p>In
      the understanding pillar we perform research projects with the\\nbroad goal
      of developing a comprehensive and critical understanding of\\nthe open research
      information landscape. Based on our scientometric\\nexpertise, some projects
      in this pillar may focus on systematically\\nmonitoring and tracking the availability
      of open research information.\\nDrawing on our expertise in sociology, anthropology,
      and science and\\ntechnology studies, other projects may be aimed at describing
      and\\nexplaining what shapes, enables, and constrains the spread, or\\nnon-spread,
      of open information practices.</p>\\n<p><strong>Intervening</strong></p>\\n<p>In
      the intervening pillar we take concrete actions to advance\\nopenness of research
      information, aiming to make openness of research\\ninformation the norm and
      to enable more transparent and responsible\\napproaches to decision making in
      science. An example is the\\ntransformation of the <a href=\\\"https://www.leidenranking.com/\\\">CWTS\\nLeiden
      Ranking</a> to a tool that is entirely based on open data,\\nresulting in a
      fully transparent and reproducible ranking. The first\\nrelease of the Open
      Edition of the Leiden Ranking will take place later\\nthis month, on January
      30. Another example is the launch of the course<a\\nhref=\\\"https://www.cwts.nl/education/cwts-course-program/scientometrics-using-open-data\\\"><em>Scientometrics\\nUsing
      Open Data</em></a>, in close collaboration with colleagues at the\\n<a href=\\\"https://openknowledge.community/\\\">Curtin
      Open Knowledge\\nInitiative (COKI)</a>. The first edition of this course took
      place in\\nNovember last year, and a next edition will be organized in March
      this\\nyear. Other actions to advance openness of research information are\\ncurrently
      in preparation. We expect to share some announcements in the\\ncoming months.</p>\\n<p><strong>Practicing</strong></p>\\n<p>Following
      the idea of \u2018practice what we preach\u2019, the practicing\\npillar focuses
      on implementing openness of research information in our\\nown way of working
      at CWTS. Within the next few years, we want our work\\nat CWTS (including <a
      href=\\\"https://cwtsbv.nl/\\\">CWTS BV</a>) to be fully\\nbased on open research
      information. In particular, our aim is that\\nfuture scientometric analyses
      performed by our center will use only data\\nfrom open sources, such as Crossref,
      DataCite, ORCID, OpenAlex,\\nOpenCitations, OpenAIRE, and others. This is part
      of a broader ambition\\nto open up the work we do at CWTS, for instance in the
      way we\\ncommunicate about our research and about other activities of our center.\\nThis
      will also include a revision and expansion of our policies for <a\\nhref=\\\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/cwts-open-science-policy\\\">open\\nscience</a>
      and <a\\nhref=\\\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/cwts-research-data-management-guidelines\\\">research\\ndata
      management</a>.</p></td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n\\n### **Our way of
      working**\\n\\nThe team of the Information & Openness focal area consists of
      more than\\n20 CWTS colleagues. Some of us are focused primarily on activities
      in\\nthe understanding pillar. Others are more focused on the intervening or\\npracticing
      pillars. We meet once every two weeks to discuss the latest\\ndevelopments around
      open research information, to share updates on\\nongoing projects and other
      activities, and to make plans for new\\ninitiatives.\\n\\nOur work also aims
      to contribute to strengthening the other two focal\\nareas of CWTS: [Engagement
      &\\nInclusion](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-focal-area-engagement-and-inclusion-a-vision-and-roadmap){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      Evaluation & Culture. Through the [UNESCO Lab on Diversity and\\nInclusion in
      Global\\nScience](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nwe
      for instance connect some of the work we do in the Information &\\nOpenness
      and Engagement & Inclusion focal areas. Likewise, our work in\\nthe [GraspOS
      project](https://graspos.eu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} and the\\n[CoARA working

      the value of cross fertilization between the Information &\\nOpenness and Evaluation
      & Culture focal areas.\\n\\nWe are also setting up collaborations with external
      partners working on\\nopen research information. Many organizations are doing
      crucial work in\\nthis area. This ranges from research groups that study openness
      of\\nresearch information to organizations that provide infrastructures for\\nopen
      research information and organizations that put the use of open\\nresearch information
      into practice (e.g.,\\n[CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/en/cnrsinfo/cnrs-has-unsubscribed-scopus-publications-database){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\n[COKI](https://open.coki.ac/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},

      of open science practices has become a prominent topic of\\nstudy for the science
      studies community. However, the research practices\\nof the community itself
      are still quite traditional. While open access\\npublishing, preprinting, open
      peer review, open data sharing, and other\\nopen science practices are gradually
      becoming more common in the science\\nstudies community, the adoption of these
      practices is still at a\\nrelatively low level.\\n\\nGiven the community's deep
      understanding of the research system, we\\nthink we should be able to do a better
      job. As organizers of this year's\\n[Science, Technology and Innovation Indicators
      conference (STI\\n2023)](https://sti2023.org){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}, we therefore
      introduce two\\nopen science experiments: We adopt a new publication and peer
      review\\nprocess, fully aligned with state-of-the-art open science practices,
      and\\nwe invite authors of contributions submitted to the conference to\\nreflect
      on their own open science practices.  \\n\\n### Experiment 1: Opening the publication
      and peer review process\\n\\nIn earlier editions of the STI conference, contributions
      submitted to\\nthe conference were reviewed in a traditional closed peer review\\nprocess.
      Contributions accepted for presentation at the conference were\\npublished in
      the conference proceedings while those not accepted for\\npresentation were
      not published.\\n\\nFor the STI 2023 conference, we are going to experiment
      with an open\\n'publish, then review' model as an alternative to the closed
      'review,\\nthen publish' approach. The publication and peer review process will
      be\\norganized as follows:  \\n\\n- The conference will use a submission and
      publication platform provided\\n  by [Orvium](https://orvium.io/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      *All contributions\\n  submitted to the conference will immediately be published
      as a\\n  preprint on the platform.* Contributions will be openly accessible\\n
      \ under a CC-BY license. Authors will retain their copyright. Each\\n  contribution
      will have its own DOI.\\n\\n<!-- -->\\n\\n- The conference will organize an
      open peer review process. *For each\\n  contribution submitted to the conference,
      the reviews will be\\n  published on the Orvium platform and will be linked
      to the preprint\\n  version of the contribution.* Reviewers will be encouraged
      to disclose\\n  their identity, but they may also choose to remain anonymous.
      Authors\\n  will be invited to update their contribution based on the feedback\\n
      \ provided by reviewers. The updated contribution will also be published\\n
      \ on the Orvium platform.\\n\\n<!-- -->\\n\\n- As conference organizers, *we
      will use the peer review results to\\n  select contributions for presentation
      at the conference.* All\\n  contributions will remain available on the Orvium
      platform, both the\\n  contributions selected for presentation and those not
      selected.\\n\\nFurther information about the publication and peer review process
      of the\\nSTI 2023 conference can be found in the [call for\\npapers](https://www.sti2023.org/call-for-papers/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      The\\n'publish, then review' model that we are going to use at the conference\\nis
      inspired by platforms such as\\n[*F1000Research*](https://f1000research.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\n[*eLife*](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.83889){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      and\\n[*Peer Community In*](https://peercommunityin.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nwhich
      [combine preprinting and open peer\\nreview](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adg2283){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      \ \\n\\n**Expected benefits**\\n\\nCompared with the publication and peer review
      process in earlier\\neditions of the STI conference, we see a number of benefits
      in our new\\napproach:  \\n\\n- *Accelerating the dissemination of new scientific
      knowledge.* The\\n  immediate publication of conference contributions as preprints
      will\\n  speed up the dissemination of new scientific knowledge. Interested\\n
      \ researchers and practitioners will have access to the latest\\n  scientific
      findings without waiting for the conference to take place.\\n\\n<!-- -->\\n\\n-
      *Increasing the value of peer review.* In the traditional closed peer\\n  review
      model used in earlier editions of the STI conference, reviews\\n  were made
      available only to the authors of a conference contribution\\n  and to the conference
      organizers. In our new open peer review model,\\n  reviews will also be made
      available to the readers of a conference\\n  contribution, helping readers to
      develop a more informed understanding\\n  of the strengths and weaknesses of
      a contribution, also the ones not\\n  selected for presentation. This will increase
      the value of the\\n  reviews.\\n\\n<!-- -->\\n\\n- *Giving more recognition
      to authors.* The immediate publication of\\n  conference contributions as preprints
      will enable authors to get\\n  feedback and credit more rapidly.\\n\\n<!-- -->\\n\\n-
      *Giving more recognition to reviewers.* In the traditional closed peer\\n  review
      model used in earlier editions of the STI conference, reviewers\\n  hardly got
      any credit for their work. In our new open peer review\\n  model, reviewers
      who choose to disclose their identity will get public\\n  recognition.\\n\\n**Potential
      concerns**\\n\\nWe recognize that the publication and peer review process of
      the STI\\n2023 conference may also raise concerns. A common objection against\\npreprinting
      is that preprints may present inaccurate results because\\nthey are published
      before peer review. While results presented in\\npreprints may indeed be inaccurate,
      the same applies to results reported\\nin peer-reviewed articles, since peer
      review usually does not resolve\\nall inaccuracies in an article. We also note
      that the reviews that will\\nbe published alongside the preprinted conference
      contributions will help\\nreaders to assess the quality of a contribution. Another
      concern about\\npreprinting is that journals might be reluctant to publish articles
      that\\nhave already been published as a preprint. However, very few journals\\nstill
      have such a policy.\\n\\nA common concern about open peer review is that criticism
      provided by\\nreviewers may be incorrect or even offensive. As conference organizers,\\nwe
      call on reviewers to give constructive and respectful feedback, for\\ninstance
      by following the [FAST (focused, appropriate, specific,\\ntransparent)\\nprinciples](https://asapbio.org/fast-principles-for-preprint-feedback){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nWe
      reserve the right to moderate reviews that we regard as\\ndisrespectful. If
      the authors of a conference contribution consider\\ncriticism provided by a
      reviewer to be incorrect, they will have the\\npossibility to publish a response
      in which they explain why they\\ndisagree with the reviewer. Authors will also
      be able to update their\\nconference contribution to address problems identified
      by reviewers.\\n\\nWe appreciate that special consideration needs to be given
      to the\\ninterests of PhD students and other researchers who find themselves
      in\\nvulnerable positions. These researchers may be disproportionately\\naffected
      by the drawbacks of the way publication and peer review\\nprocesses are organized.
      In a closed 'review, then publish' model, peer\\nreview may be biased against
      these researchers, lowering their chances\\nof getting their work published.
      In an open 'publish, then review'\\nmodel, these researchers may feel uncomfortable
      both about their own\\nwork being critiqued publicly and about publicly critiquing
      the work of\\nothers, in particular the work of more senior colleagues. In the\\nevaluation
      of our new approach to publication and peer review (see\\nbelow), we will pay
      special attention to the experiences of PhD students\\nand other researchers
      in vulnerable positions.\\n\\n### Experiment 2: Reflecting on open science practices\\n\\nAs
      organizers of the STI 2023 conference, we strongly encourage authors\\nof contributions
      submitted to the conference to adopt open science\\npractices in their work.
      At the same time, we recognize that there may\\nbe barriers to the adoption
      of such practices, including for instance\\nreliance on proprietary data sources,
      legal or ethical concerns, and\\nlack of experience with open science practices.
      Rather than introducing\\nformal open science requirements, we therefore take
      a more experimental\\napproach. We invite authors of conference contributions
      to explicitly\\nreflect on their own open science practices.\\n\\n*Each contribution
      submitted to the conference is expected to include a\\nshort section in which
      the authors reflect on the use of open science\\npractices in the research presented
      in their contribution.*Authors may\\nfor instance discuss the openness of the
      data used in their research. If\\nthe data is openly available, the authors
      can explain how the data can\\nbe obtained. If the data is not openly available,
      the authors can\\nexplain why they do not use openly available data or why they
      are unable\\nto make their data openly available. Openness of software and source\\ncodes
      can be discussed in a similar way. Authors may also discuss\\nwhether a research
      plan was made openly available at the start of their\\nresearch ('preregistration')
      or whether any intermediate results of the\\nresearch have already been published,

      and adoption of open\\nscience practices in the science studies community. In

      see how the experiments\\nwill work out. After the conference, we will invite
      conference\\nparticipants to fill in a survey to evaluate the experiments. The\\noutcomes
      of the evaluation will be reported in a blog post. In the\\nmeantime, if you
      have any questions about the experiments, or any\\nfeedback you would like to

      aims to\\ncontribute to making available the information needed by these\\nstakeholders.
      \ \\n\\n### The current landscape, and its shortcomings\\n\\nThere are numerous
      initiatives and platforms providing some part of the\\npuzzle, but information
      is scattered, incomplete, and difficult to\\ncompare. For example, tools and
      databases are available that help\\nresearchers understand how to make their
      research openly accessible\\n(DOAJ), whether their work can be posted in a repository
      or on a\\npreprint server (Sherpa Romeo), how to ensure compliance with funder\\nrequirements
      (Plan S Journal Checker Tool), and how to pick a\\npublication platform that
      offers particular peer review approaches\\n(Transpose), open science practices
      (TOP factor), or that is considered\\nto have a sufficiently high citation impact
      (Journal Citation Reports).\\n\\nGiven this complexity, it seems unrealistic
      to expect stakeholders to\\nknow which tools or databases to use to obtain specific
      information.\\n\\nAs new models of publishing such as Publish-Review-Curate,
      publication\\nas you go, preprint review and others emerge, distinct publishing\\nfunctions
      like dissemination and evaluation are increasingly decoupled.\\nThis creates
      the need for different platforms to interact and at least\\nto be aware of each
      other's policies and requirements. At present, there\\nare minimal standards
      to enable the systematic interoperability of these\\nplatforms. At the research
      output level, standards like\\n[DocMaps](https://docmaps.knowledgefutures.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      and\\nthe [COAR\\nNotify](https://www.coar-repositories.org/notify/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nprotocol
      are under development. However, to empower further innovation\\nin scholarly
      communication, a shared way to describe these different\\nplatforms and their
      possibilities of interaction is required.  \\n\\n### The Journal Observatory
      project: aims and approach\\n\\nTo address this challenge, our project aims
      to:  \\n\\n1.  define an extensible, machine-readable and traceable way to describe\\n
      \   the policies and practices of the various platforms involved in\\n    disseminating
      and evaluating scholarly works: the **Scholarly\\n    Communication Platform
      Framework  \\n    **\\n\\n2.  demonstrate the value of this new framework by
      building a\\n    demonstration prototype called the **Journal Observatory**,
      a\\n    resource which combines data on journals and other publication\\n    platforms
      from various sources to clarify policy information for\\n    authors, reviewers
      and others.\\n\\n#### **1. Scholarly Communication Platform Framework** {#scholarly-communication-platform-framework}\\n\\n[The
      Scholarly Communication Platform\\nFramework](https://www.journalobservatory.org/framework/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nis
      a new, high-level, structured language that enables the exchange of\\ninformation
      about platforms for scholarly communication. To date, we\\nhave focused on enabling
      description of platforms for the dissemination\\nand/or evaluation of research
      articles, such as scientific journals,\\npreprint servers, and peer review platforms.
      However, the Framework can\\nfairly easily be extended in the future to describe
      platforms performing\\nother scholarly communication functions (e.g., archiving
      via platforms\\nlike LOCKKS/CLOCKKS or Portico), or to describe dissemination/evaluation\\nof
      other types of scholarly outputs (books, datasets, software, code,\\nmethods,
      materials). The detailed inner-workings and rationale of the\\nFramework are
      described in our [technical\\nreport](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7860610){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nDocumentation
      and source code can be found on the [project's\\nwebpage](https://www.journalobservatory.org/framework/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      \ \\n\\n#### **2. Journal Observatory prototype** {#journal-observatory-prototype}\\n\\nThe
      Journal Observatory prototype is a proof-of-concept demonstrator\\nwhich integrates
      journal information from diverse open data sources\\nincluding DOAJ, Sherpa
      Romeo and others, as well as directly from\\npublishers. It shows the power
      of combining information from these\\ndifferent sources to support three primary
      use-case areas: open access\\npublishing, preprinting and peer review procedures.
      By making this\\ninformation available, we support researchers, publishers,
      funders and\\nresearch institutions to make informed decisions and monitor compliance.\\nThe
      prototype comes both with interfaces for machines and with a\\nuser-friendly
      web interface for humans. There are two interfaces for\\nmachines: a [SPARQL\\nendpoint](https://sparql.journalobservatory.org/sparql){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      a [REST API](https://api.journalobservatory.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThe
      web interface for humans is provided by the [Journal Observatory\\nBrowser](https://app.journalobservatory.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      More\\ninformation about the prototype, including documentation and source\\ncode,
      can be found on the [project's\\nwebpage](https://www.journalobservatory.org/prototype/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.

      alt=\\\"The Journal Observatory\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\n### **Next steps**\\n\\nThe
      Journal Observatory project has achieved much within a limited\\ntimeframe and
      with limited resources. We see our project and its outputs\\nas the start or
      continuation, not the end, of a much larger\\nconversation. We hope our work
      will provide a base for a more ambitious\\nlong-term agenda, co-shaped with
      the wider scholarly community, and\\naimed at working toward open and interoperable
      infrastructure for\\nproviding systematic and reliable information on scholarly
      journals and\\nother scholarly communication platforms.  \\n\\n### **The community
      event**\\n\\nTo mark the end of the project and to launch the project's results,
      we\\norganized an [online community\\nevent](https://www.journalobservatory.org/event/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      on\\nApril 25. During the event, we presented our work, including a live demo\\nof
      the Journal Observatory Browser to show how the tool can support\\nusers in
      efficiently finding answers to questions like: what journals in\\nmy field (e.g.
      sustainability research) provide options for Diamond Open\\nAccess publishing?
      How do the preprinting policies of two journals\\ncompare? What journals in
      my field adhere to Open Peer Review, in the\\nsense of publishing review reports?
      \ \\n\\nThe demonstration was followed by Lucy Ofiesh's (Director of Finance
      &\\nOperations at Crossref) talk on the Principles of Open Scholarly\\nInfrastructure
      (POSI). Lucy described how these principles, developed as\\na community resource
      to help guide organizations, can support the\\nresilience and sustainability
      of open infrastructure that serves the\\nscholarly communications ecosystem.\\n\\nThe
      event was concluded by a panel discussion in which three of the\\nproject's
      stakeholder advisory board members discussed their perspective\\non the need
      and future of interoperable, systematically-collected\\ninformation on scholarly
      communication platforms. Johan Rooryck\\n(Executive Director of cOAlition S),
      Catriona MacCallum (Director of\\nOpen Science at Hindawi Publishing) and Gabe
      Stein (Head of Operations\\nand Product at the Knowledge Futures Group) shared
      their view from the\\nperspective of a research agency coalition, publisher
      and infrastructure\\nprovider, respectively. They agreed that there is a dire
      need for the\\nkind of service provided by initiatives like the Journal Observatory\\nproject,
      but also identified several challenges on the road towards\\nsustainability
      of such initiatives.\\n\\nThe recording of the event can be watched\\n[here](https://www.journalobservatory.org/event/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.

      the 2021 [Recommendation on Open\\nScience](https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nbuilding
      on the notions that science is a *common good*, that all\\nhumankind should
      [enjoy the benefits of scientific\\nknowledge](https://en.unesco.org/human-rights/science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      has the right to participate in it.\\n\\nIf you agree on this understanding
      of science as a *common good,* you\\nmay reply: \\\"all right, yes, science
      is a common good, but right now:  \\n\\n- Who benefits from science?\\n- Which
      type of research topics are considered important?\\n- Who participates in making
      science and deciding which knowledge is\\n  produced?\\\"\\n\\nThe answers to
      each of these questions point in the same direction:\\nscience is heavily concentrated
      towards the interest of the privileged\\nand it supports forms of innovation
      that [actively contribute to world\\ninequalities](https://issues.org/public-value-science-innovation-equity-bozeman/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nFor
      science to be a common good, there is a need for diversity and\\ninclusion,
      which means:  \\n\\n- Widening the distribution of the benefits of science across\\n
      \ populations.\\n- Pluralising research topics.\\n- Broadening participation
      and activities in knowledge production, both\\n  of citizens and the academic
      workforce.\\n\\nThe new CWTS UNESCO Chair on Diversity and Inclusion in Global
      Science\\naims to contribute to the implementation of the 2017 and 2021 UNESCO\\nRecommendations
      through a focus on Diversity and Inclusion in Global\\nScience, in collaboration
      with a variety of research and policy partners\\nin the world.\\n\\n### **Why
      does the diversity of research topics matter for global science?**\\n\\nIt [has
      long been\\nargued](https://asset-pdf.scinapse.io/prod/2110158660/2110158660.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nthat,
      in general, diversity in research is beneficial because:\\n\\n- it fosters new
      ideas through recombination, for example in terms of\\n  interdisciplinarity;\\n-
      it is an insurance against incertitude, given that we don't know what\\n  the
      best solutions to problems are, it's better to try out different\\n  avenues;\\n-
      it prevents research from lock-in, i.e., it keeps the flexibility to\\n  adapt
      knowledge in the face of changing environments;\\n- it accommodates plural perspectives,
      i.e., it allows science to\\n  reflect the contrasting views on issues that
      exist in society.\\n\\nIf we think of science as a key element for improving
      well-being and\\nhuman development, diversity of knowledge is even more important.
      This\\nis because research agendas are too often concentrated towards the\\nissues
      and the framings that are relevant to the Global North and for\\npowerful or
      privileged actors.\\n\\nThe historical role of science in colonialism and environmental\\ndegradation
      would be examples of this concentration of research towards\\nthe interest of
      the powerful. On the contrary, there is relatively much\\nless research in topics
      which are more relevant for example for women,\\nthe Global South or some ethnic
      or indigenious groups.\\n\\n[Research efforts across\\ndiseases](https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2018/mar/16/who-benefits-from-biomedical-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nis
      a classic example of this: there is little research not only in some\\ntropical
      diseases such as malaria, but also in topics such as\\ncardiovascular diseases
      which affect poor populations, in comparison to\\ninvestments in diseases such
      as cancers which are relatively more\\nfrequent in the richest populations.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img
      src=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/who.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"29852\\\"
      />\\n</figure>\\n\\nAnother example of imbalance is [artificial\\nintelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10385){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      In\\nthis case, research is concentrated in topics that are relevant to big\\ncorporations
      rather than research involving other methods that are more\\nuseful to consider
      the societal and ethical implications of AI.\\n\\nIn short, making the contents
      of research more diverse is important for\\nscience to address the scientific
      problems associated with the\\nchallenges that matter to most people in the
      world.\\n\\n### **Why is inclusion of social groups important for global science?**\\n\\nNow,
      for research to address a wider variety of topics, and especially\\nsocietal
      challenges, it is necessary that science is more representative\\nof the world
      population. Plural representation is both [a normative and\\nsubstantive\\nimperative](https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/bitstream/handle/20.500.12413/12492/stirling_2005_opening.pdf?sequence=1).\\nIn
      other words, researchers must come from a broader variety of social\\nbackgrounds
      and citizens must participate more actively in shaping\\nknowledge so that science
      is more democratic and reflects plural\\ninterests and needs. For this purpose,
      science also needs to be created\\nand shared in local languages (as suggested
      by the [*Helsinki Initiative\\non Multilingualism*](https://www.helsinki-initiative.org/))
      and through\\n[open scholarly\\ninfrastructures](https://cameronneylon.net/blog/principles-for-open-scholarly-infrastructures/).\\n\\nIn
      recent decades, science is already undergoing a transformation in\\nthis direction,
      with the growth of [citizen\\nscience](https://www.nature.com/collections/cihfchiheh),
      and the\\nincreasing participation of concerned groups such as\\n[patients](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/health-and-care-professionals/engagement-and-participation-in-research/involve-patients.htm),\\nor
      marginalised groups in dimensions such as\\n[gender](https://ec.europa.eu/assets/rtd/shefigures2021/index.html),\\nethnicity
      or Global South countries.\\n\\nHowever, many social groups still remain heavily
      underrepresented and\\n[face discriminatory working\\nconditions](https://www.nature.com/immersive/d42859-022-00031-8/index.html)\\nor
      lack of academic freedom, and stakeholder engagement in science\\nremains a
      challenge. There is still a lot of progress to be made so that\\nscience reflects
      the plurality of world societies.\\n\\n### **How will the CWTS Chair contribute
      to UNESCO's agenda?**\\n\\nGiven the expertise of CWTS on S&T indicators and
      research assessment,\\nour Chair aims to provide evidence to raise awareness
      on existing\\nproblems in diversity and inclusion in world science. We will
      work\\nmainly along two complementary lines.\\n\\n**First, developing monitoring
      methods** that illuminate progress in the\\nadoption of the 2017 [Recommendation
      on Science and Scientific\\nResearchers](https://en.unesco.org/themes/ethics-science-and-technology/recommendation_science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nand
      the recent [Recommendation on Open\\nScience](https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nwith
      a focus on making knowledge more accessible, representative and\\nparticipatory.\\n\\nThe
      monitoring methods for these recommendations are not straightforward\\nat all
      because they are related to values and need contextualisation. We\\nhave to
      go beyond existing statistical methods. To do so, we will build\\non expertise
      developed in projects for monitoring *Responsible Research\\nand Innovation*,
      in particular\\n[SuperMoRRI.](https://super-morri.eu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\n**Second,developinga
      multi-perspective observatory of global scholarly\\ncommunication** (let's call
      it a ***Multiversatory***!), focusing on\\nmaking visible outputs and activities
      of the global academic community\\nwhich are currently invisible. A classical
      example is the exclusion of\\nnational and local scientific journals from mainstream
      scientometric\\ndatabases. So far, the global research landscape has been mapped
      using\\nselective commercial databases which miss a large share of all\\nscientific
      publications, particularly from journals in the social\\nsciences and humanities
      and from the Global South.\\n\\nHowever, more comprehensive open databases such
      as\\n[Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} and\\n[OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      are becoming\\nincreasingly available. These databases provide a more inclusive
      (though\\nstill incomplete) coverage for the Global South and also allows\\ncomparison
      of how visibility differs depending on perspectives. We\\nbelieve that with
      these new databases a step change will be soon made in\\nthe analysis of the
      geography of scholarly communication. We expect to\\nshow that [world science
      is actually more diverse than is frequently\\nbelieved](https://preprints.scielo.org/index.php/scielo/preprint/view/4729/version/5022){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nbut
      that many parts of the knowledge created often remain invisible.  \\n\",\"published_at\":1668074400,\"updated_at\":1708703227,\"indexed_at\":1708118497,\"authors\":[{\"url\":

      />\\n</figure>\\n\\nIn 2014, CWTS got involved in the [MoRRI\\nproject](https://super-morri.eu/morri-2014-2018/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nfunded
      by the European Commission (EC) to follow up on their new policy\\nof Responsible
      Research and Innovation (2013). In the policy context,\\nthe [concept of Responsibility
      is attributed to anticipatory, reflexive,\\nresponsive, and inclusive attitudes
      in research and innovation\\nprocesses](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733313000930){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      was operationalized in six key principles: gender equality, public\\nengagement,
      ethics, open access, science literacy and science education,\\nand governance.
      MoRRI followed the key principles of the EC, building\\nupon earlier indicators,
      and developing new ones, on a national level.\\nData collection across Europe
      on the actual situation was hampered by\\nthe low number of responses, and it
      was felt that such an approach\\ndidn't do justice to the diversity in policy,
      geographical and\\norganisational aspects. This was all taken up by the MoRRI
      successor,\\n[SUPER MoRRI](https://super-morri.eu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      \ \\n\\nSUPER MoRRI is one of the EC flagship projects that brings together
      the\\nEC policies on Responsible Research and Innovation, funded through the\\nH2020
      Science with and for Society (SwafS) program. It does so in\\ndifferent ways:
      continuing the MoRRI train through a significant data\\ncollection exercise,
      doing broad conceptual work through in-depth case\\nstudies, and connecting
      with European and global partners. But first,\\nthe [consortium]((hyperlink:%20https://super-morri.eu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nfelt
      that they should take the time and go back to the drawing table to\\nreflect
      on several aspects.  \\n\\n### Reflections on what monitoring and evaluation
      of RRI is\\n\\nIn the first\\n[blogpost](https://super-morri.eu/from-morri-to-super_morri-monitoring-as-reflection-and-learning-not-representation-and-control/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_of\\nthe
      SUPER\_MoRRI series, Wouter van der Klippe discusses the transition\\nfrom MoRRI
      to the new SUPER MoRRI project. When we stop focusing on the\\noutcomes of measurements
      and their accuracy and instead consider the\\npossibilities that monitoring
      provides, evaluation is set free from\\nproducing indicators. Instead, evaluation
      can be an opportunity to\\ncreate a space for articulating what is valued and
      why. Thus,\\nSUPER\_MoRRI is creating a transformative opportunity that may
      better\\nequip us to develop more open potential RRI-enriched futures, as diverse\\nand
      inclusive as were initially hoped for.\\n\\n<figure style=\\\"float:left; margin:60px

      />\\n</figure>\\n\\nBut when we talk about monitoring RRI, is there a consensus
      on the\\npurpose or even the content of RRI?\_Roger Strand [distinguishes between\\nthree
      policy narratives for\\nRRI](https://super-morri.eu/3-policy-narratives-for-rri/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_in\\nhis
      blogpost.\_They are portrayed in a slightly caricatured way and\\nexaggerate
      the differences. The first policy narrative is: \\\"How do we\\nregain control
      over the runaway train of science and technology before\\nit totally destroys
      our world?\\\" Some hope that RRI will enable society\\nto speak back to science
      and help shape research agendas and ultimately\\nresearch trajectories so that
      they will lead to outputs and outcomes\\nthat are beneficial to people and the
      planet. The second, opposite\\nnarrative is: \\\"How do we educate, reassure
      and calm down the ungrateful\\npublic and make them trust us, trust science
      again?\\\" RRI, and especially\\nthe so-called RRI \\\"keys\\\" of the EC are
      better fit for the purpose of\\nproviding accountability and legitimacy to calm
      down the citizens and\\nargue that everything is in order. The third policy
      narrative sees the\\nworld of science, technology, and society as a set of entangled
      networks\\nthat are increasingly in need of mutual collaboration and communication.\\nHere
      RRI is seen as a way to improve collaboration across silos and\\npromote thinking
      outside of the box. Therefore, it is important to be\\naware of such plurality
      of desires for RRI when working for SUPER MORRI.\\n\\n[In the third\\nreflection](https://super-morri.eu/where-are-the-people-in-innovation-monitoring/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\_Paula\\nOtero
      Hermida describes the difference between monitoring science and\\nmonitoring
      innovation. In science, there is a wide set of indicators and\\nperiodic monitoring
      efforts on e.g. gender aspects. As the main\\nreference, there are the [She
      Figures\\nreports](https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-law-and-publications/publication-detail/-/publication/67d5a207-4da1-11ec-91ac-01aa75ed71a1){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n(European
      Commission) as well as indicators in the main RRI monitoring\\ninitiatives at
      the European level. However, when looking at the\\nmonitoring of innovation,
      it seems that the current paradigm ignores who\\n(and in which conditions) innovates,
      but rather focuses on the firm's\\nenvironment and systemic variables. It is
      hence important to realise\\nwhich data are *not* available: there are no data
      on the human factor in\\nthe innovation surveys. That means we can find data
      regarding\\ninnovation's investment and firms, but there are\_limited data available\\non
      the sociodemographic traits, labor conditions, or other factors\\nregarding
      the actors that are innovating themselves. Therefore, there\\nare no data on
      gender in the case of the OECD, EUROSTAT nor in the\\ninnovation survey carried
      out by the Spanish National Institute of\\nStatistics. When data is not collected
      or available, it is important to\\nbe aware of gender and other diversity aspects,
      and include it in the\\nmonitoring framework to make it explicit.  \\n\\n###
      SUPER MoRRI's principles\\n\\nWhen we do monitoring and evaluation of RRI, we
      would like ourselves to\\nbe responsible too! That is reflected in the strategic
      plan that emerged\\nfrom the internal conversations. Richard Woolley describes
      our\\nprinciples [in the SUPER MoRRI strategic\\nplan](https://super-morri.eu/the-super-morri-strategic-plan/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\_The\\nconsortium's
      conceptual view on RRI takes\_engagement among diverse\\nconstellations of actors
      as the key driver of enhanced responsibility in\\nboth research and innovation
      and would increase consideration of\\nrelevant environmental and societal uncertainties.
      The monitoring\\nframework will provide interested stakeholders with resources
      that can\\nhelp them to plan and progress toward more responsible practices
      and\\nstrategies. This will be done on the basis of a '*responsible\\nquantification*'
      approach in which data and information are presented,\\nand made interpretable,
      in appropriate ways. A related conceptual\\ninnovation is what we call '*credible
      contextualisation'*. This is the\\nidea that any indicators we develop should,
      first, pass through a\\nco-creation phase with potential users, and second,
      be accompanied by\\nguidance on the degree of interpretive 'stickiness' of the
      indicator.\\n\\nThree years into the project, the two principles still stand
      and are\\napplied [as further elaborated by Richard\\nWoolley](https://super-morri.eu/responsible-approach-to-monitoring-rri/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_in\\na
      blogpost. Transforming these principles into a framework presenting\\nSUPER
      MoRRI indicators in three components: an indicator fiche; a\\ndescription of
      potential interpretive models; and complementary\\ninformation to support user
      understanding and interpretation of the\\nindicator. In the case of new RRI
      indicators, the interpretive model\\nwill explain the rationale for the creation
      of the indicator and how it\\nis perceived to support RRI. For indicators that
      are time-series -- or\\nhave the potential for future replication to create
      time-series -- the\\nmodel describes what a change in the indicator can be reasonably\\nunderstood
      to mean. Further information is provided to try and ensure\\nthe credible contextualisation
      of the indicator. Involving users in the\\ndevelopment phase of the indicator
      also helps to guide the design and\\nproduction of these supporting elements
      as work progresses.  \\n\\n### Putting the monitoring framework into practice\\n\\nHow
      to operationalize then the data collection in a responsible way?\\nMoving away
      from surveys and analysis at the country level, instead, we\\nfocus on the organisational
      level. [In a blog\\npost](https://super-morri.eu/what-are-country-correspondents/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\_Massimo\\nGraae
      Losinno explains how SUPER MoRRI has engaged a [panel of Country\\nCorrespondents](https://super-morri.eu/country-correspondent-network/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThe
      monitoring activities cover all EU countries, Norway, and the UK.\\nFor each
      of these 29 countries, a Country Correspondent contributed to\\ndata collection
      and reporting. Country Correspondents were chosen on the\\nbasis of their expertise
      in social science methods, their knowledge of\\nthe national research and innovation
      system in their country of\\nresidence, and their familiarity with RRI and monitoring.
      The Country\\nCorrespondents are responsible for conducting interviews and document\\nanalyses
      in relation to studies examining 55 Research Funding\\nOrganisations (RFOs,
      2 per country) and 142 Research Performing\\nOrganisations (RPOs, 4-8 per country)
      in their respective countries.\\nWith this approach we build upon local knowledge
      and qualitative methods\\nacross diverse political, cultural, and social settings,
      as well as\\ndiverse research and innovation environments.\\n\\nThe substantial
      qualitative data collection effort of the Country\\nCorrespondents is complemented
      by the repeated collection of secondary\\ndata that were presented in MoRRI
      as well, and hence provide timeseries.\\nIn [the first monitoring\\nreport](https://super-morri.eu/findings/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n(i.e.\_D2.2),\_secondary
      data on R&I expenditure, patent applications,\\nlabour market participation
      (gender equality), bibliometric data on open\\naccess, and Eurobarometer data
      are presented in a responsible way. The\\nsecond and third monitoring reports
      are available shortly from the SUPER\\nMoRRI website. Here the results of the
      RFO and RPO studies are included,\\nwhich provide for the first time extensive
      organizational level data.\\n\\nFrom the beginning, SUPER MoRRI aimed to create
      impact by connecting to\\nother funded SwafS-projects on RRI-related topics.
      And the wish from the\\nEC to take a global perspective on responsibility too,
      has been\\nimplemented through the\_[Global Satellite\\npartners](https://super-morri.eu/global-satellite-partners/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      the annual events we organized. This will be described in the second\\nblog

      IP\\n(Intellectual Property) in biotech.\_Key to Molecule's approach is the\\nuse
      of blockchains to accelerate funding biotech research and building a\\nmarketplace
      for the generated IP. They recently raised above 12M\\\\$ in\\nventure funds
      for future development. Many more Decentralized Autonomous\\nOrganizations (DAOs)
      also play a prominent role in DeSci. These are\\ncommunities managed via blockchains,
      sometimes associated with\\nincorporated entities (e.g., companies), just like
      Molecule. Another\\nexample is [VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      focused\\non crowdfunding longevity research through the VITA token.\\n\\nScientific
      publishing also attracts considerable effort in DeSci,\\nespecially towards
      re-designing the peer review system. Science\\nNon-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are
      used to record and manage scientific\\noutputs, for example Intellectual Property,
      reviews and publications.\\nSeveral initiatives focus on funding research or
      other forms of commons\\nwith a considerable degree of different instruments.

      worth mentioning that some research-focused organizations have also\\nbeen started
      with ties, yet not a direct involvement with DeSci. For\\nexample, the [Astera

      1\\\\. Distribution of funds is determined by the public using mechanisms such
      as quadratic donations or DAOs.           | Small, closed, centralized groups
      control the distribution of funds.                                           |\\n|
      2\\\\. You collaborate with peers from all over the globe in dynamic teams.
      \                                             | Funding organizations and home
      institutions limit your collaborations.                                         |\\n|
      3\\\\. Funding decisions are made online and transparently. New funding mechanisms
      are explored.                         | Funding decisions are made with a long
      turnaround time and limited transparency. Few funding mechanisms exist. |\\n|
      4\\\\. Sharing laboratory services is made easier and more transparent using
      Web3 primitives.                            | Sharing laboratory resources is
      often slow and opaque.                                                         |\\n|
      5\\\\. New models for publishing can be developed that use Web3 primitives for
      trust, transparency and universal access. | You publish through established
      pathways frequently acknowledged as inefficient, biased and exploitative.      |\\n|
      6\\\\. You can earn tokens and reputation for peer-reviewing work.                                                       |
      Your peer-review work is unpaid, benefiting for-profit publishers.                                             |\\n|
      7\\\\. You own the intellectual property (IP) you generate and distribute it
      according to transparent terms.             | Your home institution owns the
      IP you generate. Access to the IP is not transparent.                           |\\n|
      8\\\\. Sharing all of the research, including the data from unsuccessful efforts,
      by having all steps on-chain.          | Publication bias means that researchers
      are more likely to share experiments that had successful results.      |\\n\\nWhile
      some arguments appear less convincing to me, or at least not\\nclearly benefitting
      from using blockchain technology (e.g., 2, 4, 7 or\\neven 8), others not only
      intervene on open challenges in the science\\necosystem, but also promise to
      leverage the strengths of blockchain\\ntechnology (e.g., 1, 3, 5 or 6). Personally,
      the areas where I see most\\npromise for DeSci include 1) developing open and
      distributed\\ninfrastructures to track and incentivize scientific outcomes (e.g.,\\nreviews
      and replications), 2) opening alternative sources of funding,\\nand 3) providing
      a playground to experiment with organization and\\nincentive design in science
      (e.g., including around publishing and\\nfunding).\\n\\nResearchHub, the organizer
      of SciCon 2022, is a decentralized autonomous\\norganization (DAO) attempting
      to combine all three of these aspects. Let\\nus take a closer look to further
      showcase how blockchain technology is\\nbeing used in DeSci.\\n\\n### A DeSci
      organization: ResearchHub\\n\\nResearchHub is a community effort to accelerate
      the pace of scientific\\nresearch by making its publication, review and discussion
      more open and\\ncollaborative. The Hub uses a crypto currency (Research Coin
      or RSC) to\\nincentivize participation. The portal currently supports a variety
      of\\nscience publishing activities including sharing, discussing and\\nreviewing
      articles, or even incentivizing activities via bounties, such\\nas answering
      a research question.\\n\\nA central feature of ResearchHub is the possibility
      to upload a research\\npaper (or pre-print) for further analysis, as in this\\n[example](https://www.researchhub.com/paper/1272956/a-through-intact-skull-tis-chronic-window-technique-for-cortical-structure-and-function-observation-in-mice){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}:\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/desci_figure2_2022-09-19-082514_hwfm.jpg\\\"\\nalt=\\\"Desci
      figure2\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\nA paper can then be openly discussed, peer reviewed
      or summarized (like\\nin this case), via an interaction like Reddit's:\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img
      src=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/fig3.jpg\\\"\\nalt=\\\"Fig3\\\"
      />\\n</figure>\\n\\n### To know more\\n\\n[DeSci has so far developed with little
      input from the scientific\\ncommunity.](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-03642-9){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_While\\nthe
      movement is young and sensitive to the broader crypto market\\nsentiment, we
      can certainly use more experimentation in how we go about\\ndoing science. Often,
      it is easier and faster to think outside of the\\nestablished system. This means
      that, while many, if not most DeSci\\nprojects might not last, the movement
      has the potential to develop\\nout-of-the-box solutions to at least some of
      the considerable challenges\\ncurrently facing scientific research. To know
      more, the best way is to\\ncheck [this very comprehensive and up-to-date overview
      of DeSci\\ninitiatives](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aQC6zn-eXflSmpts0XGE7CawbUEHwnL6o-OFXO52PTc/edit){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand,

      approaches are typically based on data from proprietary sources or\\nthey rely
      on non-transparent algorithms.\\n\\nWe introduce an open approach to the algorithmic

      we\\ndeveloped more than a decade\\nago](https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0532v1){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      While this\\nmethodology was originally applied to closed data from proprietary\\nsources,
      we now apply it to open data from\\n[OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      We make available a\\nfully open classification of publications. The research
      areas in this\\nclassification are labeled using a new labeling approach, and
      the\\nclassification is presented visually using the [VOSviewer Online\\nsoftware](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nWe
      also release open source software that enables anyone to reproduce\\nand extend
      our work.  \\n\\n### Building the classification\\n\\nWe built [our\\nclassification](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10560276){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nbased
      on OpenAlex data, using the\\n[snapshot](https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/openalex-snapshot){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nreleased
      on November 21, 2023. Over the past years, our methodology has\\nbeen used to
      create classifications based on Web of Science and Scopus\\ndata. These classifications
      are available in\\n[InCites](https://clarivate.com/blog/introducing-citation-topics/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand\\n[SciVal](https://www.elsevier.com/products/scival/overview/topic-prominence){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nrespectively.
      Compared to Web of Science and Scopus, OpenAlex has the\\nbenefit that its data
      is fully open and that it offers a broader\\ncoverage of the scholarly literature.\\n\\nTo
      build our classification, we used the so-called [extended direct\\ncitation
      approach](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00035){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin combination
      with the [Leiden\\nalgorithm](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41695-z){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThe
      source code of the software we used is available\\n[here](https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/publicationclassification){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nOur
      classification covers the 71 million journal articles, proceedings\\npapers,
      preprints, and book chapters in OpenAlex that were published\\nbetween 2000
      and 2023 and that are connected to each other by citation\\nlinks. Based on
      1715 million citation links, we built a three-level\\nhierarchical classification.
      Each publication was assigned to a research\\narea at each of the three levels
      of the classification. Research areas\\nconsist of publications that are relatively
      strongly connected by\\ncitation links and that can therefore be expected to
      be topically\\nrelated. At each level of the classification, a publication was
      assigned\\nto only one research area, which means research areas do not overlap.\\n\\nUsing
      the parameter values reported in Table 1, we obtained a\\nclassification that
      consists of 4521 research areas at the lowest (most\\ngranular) level, 917 research
      areas at the middle level, and 20 research\\nareas at the highest (least granular)
      level. We also algorithmically\\nlinked each research area in our classification
      to one or more of the\\nfollowing five broad main fields: biomedical and health
      sciences, life\\nand earth sciences, mathematics and computer science, physical
      sciences\\nand engineering, and social sciences and humanities.\\n\\n|                        |

      the research areas in an algorithmically built publication\\nclassification
      is a challenging problem. The labeling approach\\nintroduced in our original
      methodology yields a list of five\\ncharacteristic terms for each research area.
      While these terms usually\\ngive a reasonably good impression of the topics
      covered by a research\\narea, our experience is that users often want to have
      a single term that\\nsummarizes what a research area is about.\\n\\nLarge language
      models (LLMs) offer important new opportunities to label\\nresearch areas. We
      therefore used the [Updated GPT 3.5 Turbo\\nLLM](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\ndeveloped
      by OpenAI, to label the 4521 research areas at the lowest\\nlevel in our classification.
      The source code of our software can be\\nfound\\n[here](https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/publicationclassificationlabeling){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nFor
      each research area, we provided the LLM with the titles of the 250\\nmost cited
      publications in the area, along with the prompt shown in\\nBox 1. Using this
      prompt, we asked the LLM to return a label for each\\nresearch area, both a
      short one (max. three words) and a longer one\\n(max. eight words). We also
      requested the LLM to provide a few sentences\\nthat summarize what the research
      area is about.\\n\\n::: {style=\\\"padding:10px; background-color:#F5F5F5;\\\"}\\nYou

      Visualizing the classification\\n\\nA powerful way to use our publication classification
      is to create\\ninteractive landscapes of science. Figure 1 presents an example
      of such\\na landscape. It was created using the [VOSviewer Online\\nsoftware](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1).\\nWe
      used the software to visualize the 4521 research areas at the lowest\\nlevel

      the bubble, the larger the number of publications in the research\\narea. The

      areas in terms of citation links. In general,\\nthe smaller the distance between
      two bubbles, the stronger the citation\\nlinks between the two research areas.

      Open access: a change in publishing with a limited reach\\n\\nOpen Access is
      a movement and policy directive dedicated to reforming\\nthe closed or subscription-based
      gatekeeping of scientific research. In\\nthe subscription-based\_(when readers
      pay) model scientists communicate\\nthe results of their research, by submitting
      it to publishers, and in\\nmany cases to one of a small number of large commercial
      publishers,\\nconsidered to be [an\\noligopoly](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127502){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nPublishers
      \\\\'process\\\\' this work, then provide academic institutions\\n(i.e., libraries)
      with an \\\\'opportunity\\\\' to buy back research via\\njournal subscriptions.
      This is neither sound economically, nor is it\\nconducive to the growth of scientific
      knowledge. Open Access has\\ntherefore become a critically assessed and well-researched
      subject,\\nfocused on alternative approaches to publishing - i.e., green, gold,
      and\\nhybrid journal publishing, and Article Processing Fees (APCs) paid by\\ninstitutions
      or scholars themselves (author pays model). As a global\\nproject there is ample
      evidence that Open Access has a [limited\\nreach](https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/97555){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\n###
      Journal citation indexing and ranking (Assessment)\\n\\nDr. Eugene Garfield
      is a renowned figure in certain scientific\\ncommunities for having founded
      the [Institute for Scientific Information\\n(ISI)](https://clarivate.com/the-institute-for-scientific-information/history-of-isi/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nand
      for his [innovation in automated journal citation indexing - the\\nfirst *Science
      Citation\\nIndex*](http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/science1955.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nDr.
      Garfield lived a long and successful life (until the age of 91!);\\nlong enough
      to see his *Science Citation Index* grow to be one of the\\nmost useful reference
      tools for scholars and scientometricians\\nworldwide. Today, this index has
      been expanded commercially to include\\nadditional products, which are now part
      of Clarivate\\\\'s trademarked *Web\\nof Science\u2122*.\\n\\nDr. Garfield\\\\'s
      vision was not only to trace the history of ideas, but\\ndevelop a tool to assist
      university/college libraries with their journal\\nselection needs: a one-time
      legitimate process that had already been on\\nthe minds of other scientists.
      [Gross and Gross\\n(1927)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1651803){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      are\\ncredited by Garfield for being the first to ask: \\\\\\\"*What files of\\nscientific
      periodicals are needed in a college library to prepare the\\nstudent for advanced
      work\\\\... ?*\\\\\\\". The answer was to \\\\\\\"*compile a\\njournal list\\\"*
      considered to be \\\\\\\"*indispensable*\\\\\\\", and to base this\\nlist on
      an *\\\\\\\"arbitrary standard of some kind by which to determine the\\ndesirability
      of purchasing a particular journal\\\\\\\"* (p. 1713). That\\narbitrary standard
      was to focus on their citedness. Years later,\\n[Brodman\\n(1944)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC194405/pdf/mlab00266-0074.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nbecame
      a critic of [Gross and Gross\\\\'s\\n(1922](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1651803){target=\\\"_blank\\\"})\\nquantitative
      method, then shortly after, [Fussler\\n(1949)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4303733){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      took up\\nthe task again of listing leading journals. However, it was Dr.\\nGarfield,
      along with his innovation in electronic indexing, who\\nintroduced the [Journal
      Impact Factor\\n(JIF](http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/V1p527y1962-73.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\n\\nFor
      a long time, *the Science Citation Index* had a positive impact.\\nAlthough
      Garfield both witnessed and warned against the misuse of the\\nJIF when evaluating
      individuals, he is 'blissfully' unaware of the scale\\nof problems resulting
      from the [use of the Journal Impact\\nFactor](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-007-2036-x){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nNow,
      we are looking down a long dark hallway leading to what some might\\ncall\\n\\\\'[grimpact](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2019/05/28/grimpact-time-to-acknowledge-the-dark-side-of-the-impact-agenda/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\\\'.\\nIf
      we exit this dark hallway, we veer into a lit room called \\\\'Open\\nAccess\\\\',
      but, how does this relate to research assessment, and when did\\nwe get here?
      To answer this, we can go further back in history, when\\nscience first handed
      itself over to the profitable business of scholarly\\npublishing.\\n\\n### The
      growth of commercial publishing and journals (Access)\\n\\nWhen scientific letters,
      reports, and later periodicals first appeared\\n(i.e., the [*Philosophical Transactions
      of the Royal\\nSociety*](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/information-culture/the-mostly-true-origins-of-the-scientific-journal/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"})\\nthere
      were good reasons to outsource publishing to fledgling businesses.\\nEarly editors,
      like Henry Oldenburg (i.e., founding editor of the\\n*Philosophical Transactions*),
      were keen to generate income, but soon\\nrecognized how difficult it was to
      process, print, collect subscription\\nfees and manage society publications
      without accruing financial losses.\\nCommercial publishing grew at one time
      from a legitimate and realistic\\nneed. Editors required the support, and were
      for the most part, relieved\\nto hand over the work. In the beginning scientific
      publishing was not\\nprofitable, but gradually it became more so. New businesses
      were\\nfounded, and for the past three and half centuries we have seen journals\\ngrow
      at an [exponential\\nrate,](https://doi.org/10.1533/9781780634647.159){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\namounting
      to more than\\n[30,000](https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20180905095203579){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nthough
      according to [recent\\nestimates](https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/doi/10.1162/qss_a_00228/114119/Recalibrating-the-Scope-of-Scholarly-Publishing-A){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nthis
      number falls woefully short.\\n\\n### Digital publishing and pay models (Affordability)\\n\\nWe
      have now moved further and further away from this print-based\\nhistory, having
      stepped firmly into the digital age. Digital publishing\\nis less costly, and
      affords a significantly broader reach. However, the\\ncommercial subscription
      model paired with the ISI-Citation Index and\\nelite selection of journals (based
      on the JIF) contributes not only to\\nthe evaluation problem, but the access
      problem as well.\\n\\nWith the legacy of print maintained, Open Access is transitioning\\ntowards
      a 'flipped' publishing economy solution, with an increasing\\nmarket concentration
      of academic publishers. This development is pushed\\nby science policy and transformative
      agreements, but also by the\\nacquisitions of Open Access publishers. Consumption-side
      business models\\nare slowly being replaced by supply-side-business models,
      but we cannot\\nassume that [there will always be enough money in the academic\\nsystem](https://doi.org/10.1002/leap.1219){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      Some\\nscholars can benefit from [Plan\\nS](https://www.coalition-s.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      which allows them to\\nrely on public research funding to make research results
      immediately\\naccessible, but such affordability is not available to all. Research\\nshows
      that when scholars intend to submit a new manuscript for\\npublication, [consideration
      is still given to the prestige attached to a\\nhighly-ranked\\njournal](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20191574){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nEmpirical
      studies in the field of biomedicine have also shown how\\n[knowledge production
      is consolidated around the\\nJIF.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11024-015-9274-5){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nMany
      journals are simply privileged with a high rank, because of a\\n[strong age\\nbias](https://doi.org/10.5465/amle.2009.37012185){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      And,\\nin the age of AI, new empirical research has found that a [journal's\\nimpact
      factor is a bad predictor for 'thoroughness' and 'helpfulness' of\\nreviews.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02787-5){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_\\n\\nThus,
      it seems more important than ever to ask ourselves how we can\\ncontinue with
      Open Access, when the technology behind indexing, and the\\njournal reputation
      economy has added to continued problems.  \\n\\n### Open Access Ideology  {#open-access-ideology}\\n\\nMost
      academics are keen to support Open Access. Some are even Open\\nAccess ideologists.
      Certain ideologists may be refusing to publish\\ncontent in any journal which
      is currently not freely available and fully\\naccessible. Some might even refuse
      to carry out peer review for\\npublishers that they do not respect *(note: Why
      should I volunteer my\\ntime and efforts to support a greedy industry?)*\\n\\nAn
      approach like this, with all good intentions, has a downside. Though\\nit is
      meant to put pressure on the commercial publishing industry, it is\\nsocially
      and scientifically unaffordable for many members of our broader\\nscientific
      community, especially [at a time when peer review is in\\ncrisis](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2022/06/13/peer-review-crisis-creates-problems-journals-and-scholars){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nScholars
      are responsible for peer review, yet find it difficult amidst\\nthis tension
      between open access and paywalled content. The last thing\\nthat we need is
      fewer reviewers to call upon, or at least one less in\\nsituations where certain
      researchers have little choice but to publish\\nin one of the commercially indexed,
      paywalled journals.\\n\\nPerhaps support for Open Access no longer demands that
      we focus *solely*\\non current ideologies attributed to this mandate. Is it
      not time to exit\\nthe well-lit OA-room and trip down that long dark hallway
      again, towards\\na radically new, and disruptive socio-technical innovation?\\n\\n###
      Socio-Technical Innovation\\n\\nThe creation of a systemic change, or shift
      in perceptions and behaviour\\npatterns within our global scientific community
      implies that [innovation\\nstarts with some sort of 'symbolic\\nstrategy'](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/how-to-change-the-world-9780195334760?cc=dk&lang=en&){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nA
      strategy, which encourages scholars and institutions worldwide, to\\nrelinquish
      the symbolic nature of journal rank and prestige, especially\\nin evaluation
      systems.\\n\\nDr. Garfield was a socio-technical innovator for his time. He
      took us\\nfrom the print age into the electronic age. We have also been introduced\\nto
      the semantic Web, and now we are at the development stages of Web\\n5.0 - the
      open, linked, and intelligent Web. Let us not forget that [Tim\\nBerners-Lee's
      idea behind the Web in the first place was to keep track\\nof scientific\\ninformation](https://home.web.cern.ch/science/computing/birth-web){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}!\\nIn
      addition to a symbolic shift within the scientific/scholarly\\ncommunication
      system we can move towards a material or tangible shift.\\n\\nImagine, therefore;
      a reputation economy in science/scholarship, which\\nis not attached to journal
      rank and title. What is a scientific journal,\\nif not its editor-in-chief,
      editorial board, and thousands of volunteer\\nacademics worldwide who peer review
      submitted manuscripts? Many, if not\\nmost scholars believe in preserving the
      journal, and we will likely find\\nit difficult to forget about them. Journals
      perform a constituent and\\norganising role; a tangible outlet for scientific
      fields and\\ndisciplines. But, if we open ourselves up to more radical solutions,
      we\\nmight rather focus on preserving the registering, curating, evaluating,\\ndisseminating,
      and archiving function of journals, whilst keeping in\\nmind that[*their real
      value* lies in the communities that they\\ncreate.](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2019/03/29/the-value-of-a-journal-is-the-community-it-creates-not-the-papers-it-publishes/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nEditors
      and editorial teams, for example, may choose to forgo journal\\n*titles* altogether
      and exit a commercial publisher (Note: [Exits do\\nhappen, as in the case of
      an editor and editorial board leaving a\\ncommercial publisher to form a new
      Open Access\\njournal](https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/1/1/1/15579/Opening-science-The-rebirth-of-a-scholarly-journal?searchresult=1){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\nIn
      Shakespearian terms, what is in a name if 'by any other name' the\\nrose would
      'smell as sweet!' (i.e., journal name is different, but the\\neditorial community
      is the same, and scholars continue to respect that\\neditorial community)? In
      a similar vein, editorial boards might be\\nencouraged to leave a commercial
      publisher, and move to an Open Access\\nInternational Scholarship Space: A space
      [focused on managing and\\nmaintaining digitally transformed scholarly\\nrecords](https://zenodo.org/record/6948200#.ZD_Pyy9Byjh){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nwhich
      fulfils the traditional functions of a journal, ready to adapt to\\nany future
      needs.\\n\\nImagine a solution where an editor and editorial team are assigned
      to a\\ntopic management center of their own creation (i.e., [a kind of digital\\nlibrary](https://doi.org/10.3390/publications11010007){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nor
      [scholarly digital\\ninfrastructure](https://zenodo.org/records/5564003){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\nAt
      each online center, there could be a description of the topic area,\\nincluding
      the specialty research areas of the editorial team. So, for\\nexample, if we
      renounce a commercially published journal called the\\n\\\"*Journal of the Information
      Age*\\\" and renounce the titled journal\\ncalled \\\"*Quantitative Studies
      of Quantitativeness*\\\", our international\\ncommunity would then think about
      putting an article up for review at the\\n\\\"A Topic-Editorial Team\\\" or
      the \\\"B Topic-Editorial Team\\\".\\n\\nWhatever solution we choose, it starts
      with abandoning journal titles\\nand rank then shifting to an innovative international\\nsocio-technological
      platform, based on key journal functions. The result\\nwould still be accessible
      research, still peer reviewed, and valued\\naccording to what should be valued:
      editorial teams and engaged peer\\nreview.\\n\\nThis solution may be realised
      in many different shapes or forms, and may\\nnot necessarily solve all problems.
      We are not aiming to be strictly\\nprescriptive here. However, it would put
      the scholarly record keeping\\nfirmly back into our own hands, and not in the
      hands of commercial\\nownership, though any kind of solution can include some
      commercial\\nservice providers (e.g., technical expertise, administrative support;\\nstyle-setting/XML).
      It would also enable us to give more attention to\\nother issues, like [challenges
      associated with peer\\nreview](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-00403-8){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nTaking
      such steps would be difficult, but we believe that the\\ninternational science
      community is ready, and that there is more to gain\\nthrough technological innovation.\\n\\n

      in particular\\nthe affiliation data for linking publications to universities.
      In this\\npost, we address these questions by distinguishing between two models\\nfor
      curating affiliation data: the centralized and closed model and the\\ndecentralized
      and open model. While the traditional Leiden Ranking\\nrelies primarily on the
      centralized and closed model, the [Open Edition\\nreleased\\ntoday](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-leiden-ranking-open-edition){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nrepresents
      a movement toward the decentralized and open model.\\n\\n### **The centralized
      and closed model for data curation**\\n\\nIn the centralized and closed model,
      a central actor in the system takes\\nresponsibility for data curation. The
      data is closed. It can be accessed\\nonly by selected users, who typically need
      to pay to get access.\\n\\nThe [traditional Leiden\\nRanking](https://www.leidenranking.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      based on\\nclosed data from [Web of\\nScience](https://webofscience.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      takes a mostly\\ncentralized approach to curating affiliation data. While some
      basic data\\ncuration (standardizing affiliation strings) is performed by Web
      of\\nScience, the bulk of the work is done by CWTS (determining which\\nstandardized
      affiliation strings refer to the same 'unified\\norganizations'). Because Web
      of Science data is closed, CWTS is unable\\nto share the curated data. This
      means there is no easy way for\\nuniversities to check the quality of the data.\\n\\n###
      **The decentralized and open model for data curation**\\n\\nIn the decentralized
      and open model, data curation takes place in a\\ndecentralized way. Different
      actors in the system take responsibility\\nfor different parts of the data curation
      process. All data is fully\\nopen, which facilitates collaboration between the
      different actors.\\n\\nThe [Leiden Ranking Open\\nEdition](https://open.leidenranking.com){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      based on open\\ndata from [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      takes a\\nmostly decentralized approach to curating affiliation data.\\nContributions
      to the data curation process are made by a number of\\ndifferent actors:\\n\\n-
      The [Research Organization Registry\\n  (ROR)](https://ror.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      provides ROR IDs for\\n  research organizations.\\n- Publishers deposit publication
      metadata, including author\\n  affiliations, to\\n  [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      and\\n  [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n-
      Crossref and PubMed make publication metadata, including author\\n  affiliations,
      openly available.\\n- OpenAlex ingests author affiliations from Crossref and
      PubMed. It\\n  performs web scraping to obtain missing author affiliations.
      It then\\n  uses a [machine learning\\n  algorithm](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ppbKRVtyneWc7Hjpo8TOm57YLGx1C2Oo/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112616748913247881031&rtpof=true&sd=true){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n
      \ to map affiliation strings to ROR IDs.\\n- CWTS maps ROR IDs to 'unified organizations'.
      For instance, the ROR\\n  IDs of Leiden University\\n  ([https://ror.org/027bh9e22](https://ror.org/027bh9e22){target=\\\"_blank\\\"})\\n
      \ and Leiden University Medical Center\\n  ([https://ror.org/05xvt9f17](https://ror.org/05xvt9f17){target=\\\"_blank\\\"})\\n
      \ are both mapped to Leiden University, since the Leiden Ranking\\n  considers
      Leiden University Medical Center to be part of Leiden\\n  University.\\n\\nThe
      above actors all share data openly. This enables research\\norganizations to
      check the quality of the data and to contribute to the\\ndata curation process
      by reporting data quality problems to the relevant\\nactors (e.g., ROR, OpenAlex,
      or CWTS).\\n\\n### **How much difference does it make?**\\n\\nOver the past
      months, many people have asked us to what extent results\\nobtained from the
      data curation approach taken in the Leiden Ranking\\nOpen Edition are different
      from results obtained from the data curation\\napproach of the traditional Leiden
      Ranking. To answer this question, we\\nmatch publications in OpenAlex and Web
      of Science based on DOIs and we\\nthen use this matching to compare the results
      obtained using the two\\ndata curation approaches. Our focus is on publications
      from the period\\n2018-2021.\\n\\nWe first compare the overall set of publications
      included in the\\ntraditional Leiden Ranking to the overall set of publications
      included\\nin the Open Edition. The traditional Leiden Ranking includes all\\npublications
      in Web of Science that are indexed in the Science Citation\\nIndex, the Social
      Sciences Citation Index, or the Arts & Humanities\\nCitation Index, that are
      classified as research article or review\\narticle, and that meet a [number
      of additional\\ncriteria](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nLikewise,
      the OpenEdition includes all publications in OpenAlex that are\\nclassified
      as article or book chapter, that have affiliation and\\nreference metadata (for
      some publications this metadata is missing in\\nOpenAlex), and that meet [additional
      criteria similar to those used in\\nthe traditional Leiden\\nRanking](https://open.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nFigure
      1 shows the overlap of the two sets of publications.\\n\\n<figure style=\\\"text-align:center;\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/CHqAQGjgvLm3dbRODzOG9mn5JESRP3uMrhJmchomD5v76-VpTFlHMRSkmTqT-sfQNHGwU1iClTRujekbBzWjsiouoXpA0VVwdXxoCaXrfb5X7U6-tBxrP6NDE8gTtv2-jD68dI00r2z_YrFZXXAQKbY\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"l1wpg7hao3a3\\\"

      \ \\n\\nOf the 9.3 million publications included in the Open Edition, 2.5\\nmillion
      (27%) are not included in the traditional Leiden Ranking. The\\nmost important
      reason is that publications are not covered by the Web of\\nScience citation
      indexes on which the traditional Leiden Ranking is\\nbased (i.e., Science Citation
      Index, Social Sciences Citation Index, and\\nArts & Humanities Citation Index).
      This explains why 1.7 million\\npublications (19%) included in the Open Edition
      are not included in the\\ntraditional Leiden Ranking.\\n\\nConversely, of the
      7.4 million publications included in the traditional\\nLeiden Ranking, 0.7 million
      (9%) are not included in the Open Edition.\\nThere are several reasons for this.
      Inconsistencies in publication years\\n(e.g., a publication was published in
      2017 according to OpenAlex, while\\nit was published in 2018 according to Web
      of Science) are an important\\nreason, explaining why 0.2 million publications
      (3%) are not included in\\nthe Open Edition while they are included in the traditional
      Leiden\\nRanking. However, the most important reason is missing affiliation
      data\\nin OpenAlex. 0.3 million publications (4%) are not included in the Open\\nEdition
      because of missing author affiliations in OpenAlex, showing that\\nmissing affiliation
      data is a weakness of OpenAlex.\\n\\nWe now provide a more detailed analysis
      for the 6.8 million publications\\nthat are included in both the traditional
      Leiden Ranking and the Open\\nEdition. For each of the 1411 universities in
      the Leiden Ranking 2023,\\nwe calculated the percentage of the publications
      of the university in\\nthe traditional Leiden Ranking that are not assigned
      to the university\\nin the Open Edition. Figure 2 shows this percentage for
      each university,\\nsorted from the highest to the lowest percentage.\\n\\n<figure

      \ \\n\\nFigure 2 shows there are three universities for which more than 30%
      of\\nthe publications in the traditional Leiden Ranking are not assigned to\\nthe
      university in the Open Edition. In two cases this appears to be due\\nto errors
      in the traditional Leiden Ranking, while in one case this\\nseems to be due
      to errors in the Open Edition. There are 88 universities\\nfor which between
      10% and 30% of the publications in the traditional\\nLeiden Ranking are not
      assigned to the university in the Open Edition.\\nFor the other 1320 universities
      this is the case for less than 10% of\\nthe publications in the traditional
      Leiden Ranking.\\n\\nWe manually examined a random sample of 25 publications
      assigned to a\\nuniversity in the traditional Leiden Ranking but not in the
      Open\\nEdition. For this small sample, we found that in 6 cases (24%) the\\nassignment
      in the traditional Leiden Ranking was incorrect (because of\\nan error made
      by either Web of Science or CWTS). In the other 19 cases\\n(76%), an assignment
      incorrectly had not been made in the Open Edition\\n(in most cases because of
      either a missing author affiliation in\\nOpenAlex or an error in the mapping
      performed by OpenAlex from an\\naffiliation string to a ROR ID).\\n\\nFigure
      3 offers the opposite perspective of Figure 2. For each of the\\n1411 universities,
      we calculated the percentage of the publications of\\nthe university in the
      Leiden Ranking Open Edition that are not assigned\\nto the university in the
      traditional Leiden Ranking. These percentages\\nare shown in Figure 3, again

      \ \\n\\nAs Figure 3 shows, there are 14 universities for which more than 30%
      of\\nthe publications in the Open Edition are not assigned to the university\\nin
      the traditional Leiden Ranking. In about two-thirds of the cases this\\nappears
      to be due to errors in the Open Edition, while in the other\\ncases this seems
      to be due to errors in the traditional Leiden Ranking.\\nThere are 91 universities
      for which between 10% and 30% of the\\npublications in the Open Edition are
      not assigned to the university in\\nthe traditional Leiden Ranking. For the
      other 1306 universities this is\\nthe case for less than 10% of the publications
      in the Open Edition.\\n\\nIn a manual analysis of a random sample of 25 publications
      assigned to a\\nuniversity in the Open Edition but not in the traditional Leiden\\nRanking,
      we found that in 19 cases (76%) the assignment in the Open\\nEdition was incorrect
      (in most cases because of an error in the mapping\\nperformed by OpenAlex from
      an affiliation string to a ROR ID). In the\\nother 6 cases (24%), an assignment
      incorrectly had not been made in the\\ntraditional Leiden Ranking (for a variety
      of reasons).\\n\\nIn summary, for publications included in both the traditional
      Leiden\\nRanking and the Open Edition, our findings show that for most\\nuniversities
      the data curation yields similar results in the two\\neditions of the ranking.
      When there are differences, errors are about\\nthree times more likely in the
      Open Edition than in the traditional\\nLeiden Ranking.\\n\\n### **Room for improvement**\\n\\nThe
      bibliometric community has extensive experience with the centralized\\nand closed
      model for data curation. Over the years, databases such as\\nWeb of Science,
      Scopus, and Dimensions have made considerable\\ninvestments in this model. Research
      organizations have also made large\\ninvestments in it, both by paying to get
      access to the above-mentioned\\ndatabases and by helping these databases improve
      their data (e.g., by\\nreporting data quality problems, such as publications
      that are assigned\\nto an incorrect organization). Likewise, by performing extensive\\ncuration
      of affiliation data for the traditional Leiden Ranking based on\\nWeb of Science
      data, CWTS has also invested substantially in a mostly\\ncentralized approach
      to data curation.\\n\\nThe bibliometric community has less experience with the
      decentralized\\nand open model for data curation. Nevertheless, the results
      presented\\nabove show that the quality of affiliation data obtained through
      a more\\ndecentralized approach is already quite good. Moreover, there are lots\\nof
      opportunities to further improve the data quality. Different actors\\ncan contribute
      to this in different ways:\\n\\n- OpenAlex can contribute by making further
      improvements to the\\n  completeness of its affiliation data and to the machine
      learning\\n  algorithm it uses to map affiliation strings to ROR IDs.\\n- Research
      organizations can contribute by reporting data quality\\n  problems to OpenAlex.
      This will help OpenAlex to improve the quality\\n  of its data. Because OpenAlex
      data is open, anyone can identify\\n  problems in the data. This is different
      for closed databases, where\\n  only those who pay to get access to a database
      can identify problems.\\n- Publishers can contribute by attaching ROR IDs to
      author affiliations\\n  in publications and by [depositing not only affiliation
      strings but\\n  also ROR IDs to\\n  Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/community/ror/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n
      \ Several publishers, for instance Optica Publishing Group and eLife,\\n  have
      already started to do this. This enables OpenAlex to ingest ROR\\n  IDs from
      Crossref instead of inferring these IDs algorithmically.\\n- CWTS and other
      providers of bibliometric analytics can contribute by\\n  monitoring the quality
      of the affiliation data obtained from OpenAlex\\n  and by providing feedback
      to OpenAlex. If necessary, providers of\\n  bibliometric analytics can perform
      their own curation of affiliation\\n  data as a complement or substitute to
      the data curation performed by\\n  OpenAlex.\\n- All actors in the system can
      contribute by working together with ROR\\n  to make improvements to the registry.
      In particular, research\\n  organizations can make an essential contribution
      by providing\\n  authoritative curations on the relationships between institutions
      and\\n  their constituent parts.\\n\\n### **The power of the decentralized and
      open model**\\n\\nWe seem to have reached the limits of what can be achieved
      using the\\ncentralized and closed model for curating affiliation data. While
      for\\ncertain use cases the model may yield an acceptable data quality, the\\nmodel
      is also highly resource-demanding, non-transparent, and\\ninflexible.\\n\\nAlthough
      the decentralized and open model is still in an early stage of\\ndevelopment,
      it already yields a surprisingly good data quality.\\nMoreover, by distributing
      the responsibility for different parts of the\\ndata curation process to different
      actors in the system, the model is\\nmore efficient and scalable than the centralized
      and closed model. On\\ntop of this, the decentralized and open model facilitates
      transparency\\nand accountability, and offers the flexibility needed to address\\ndifferent
      use cases that require different choices to be made in the\\ndata curation process.
      Finally, the decentralized and open model ensures\\nthat investments in data
      curation benefit the global academic community\\ninstead of increasing the value
      of proprietary data sources.\\n\\nBy [opening up the Leiden\\nRanking](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-leiden-ranking-open-edition){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nwe
      are moving toward a powerful new model for curating affiliation data.\\nWe invite
      universities to critically examine the affiliation data used\\nin the Leiden
      Ranking Open Edition. Feedback from universities will help\\nto further develop
      the decentralized and open model for data curation\\nand to realize the highest
      possible data quality.  \\n\\n*We thank colleagues at the Curtin Open Knowledge

      of the 'European Open\\nScience Cloud' as a central platform to publish, find
      and reuse research\\nassets. Simultaneously, European funding prioritises open
      science\\npractices in the form of sharing of publications and data 'as open
      as\\npossible and as closed as necessary'.\\n\\nIndeed it seems that these policy
      investments do carry fruits as can be\\nseen in the formation of national bodies,
      like\_[Open Science\\nNetherlands](https://www.openscience.nl/en){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      that were\\nheralded as supporting the advancement of open science on country-level\\nor
      the evident\_[inclusion of open science in university\\nstrategies](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/strategic-plan-2025.){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nNonetheless,
      open science is also a\_terribly ambiguous\_['umbrella\\nterm'](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-00026-8_2){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_that\\nis
      enacted in multiple ways across different research communities.\\nConceptions
      range from purely output-oriented notions surrounding open\\naccess to process-oriented
      priorities, such as engaging non-academics in\\nknowledge production. As my
      colleagues Ismael Rafols and Ingeborg Meijer\\nsummarise in their blogpost on\_[monitoring
      open\\nscience](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/08/14/the-benefits-of-open-science-are-not-inevitable-monitoring-its-development-should-be-value-led){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}:
      \ \\n\\nWhen relating this ambiguity to research(er) assessment, it becomes\\nevident
      that the proliferation of open science practices challenges the\\nmonochromatic
      properties of publication-driven research(er) assessments.\\nThis urges research
      assessment to be reconsidered in the light of open\\nscience. Luckily, there
      has been much work in making research(er)\\nassessment more polychromatic. This
      has been spearheaded by initiatives\\nsuch as [DORA](https://sfdora.org/about-dora/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      has\\nstabilised with the formulation of the [Hong Kong\\nPrinciples](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000737){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      recently has institutionalised in the [Coalition for Advancing\\nResearch Assessment](https://coara.eu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      (COARA); a\\nmassive undertaking that supports the adoption of responsible research\\nassessment
      practices across knowledge producing organisations. Indeed,\\nCoARA's description
      on their webpage summarises briefly what responsible\\nresearch assessment means
      for them:\\n\\nSimilarly to open science, [responsible research assessment describes
      a\\nbroad range of\\naspirations](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/navigating-responsible-research-assessment-guidelines#:~:text=RRA%20%22is%20an%20umbrella%20term,diverse%20and%20inclusive%20research%20cultures.%22){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      research assessment that largely focus on the responsible use of\\nresearch
      metrics in assessment contexts and the fostering of an\\ninclusive and diverse
      research culture in science through assessment.\\nThese developments in research
      assessment recognise and promote\\npractices that paint a more polychromatic
      picture of science, where\\nresearch(ers) are recognised and rewarded for more
      than the outputs they\\nproduce.\\n\\nBoth developments -- open science and
      responsible research assessment --\\nhave a unique opportunity to strengthen
      and reinforce one another.\\nResearch assessment reform can provide the institutional
      incentives to\\nthe adoption of open scientific practices in research, and the
      diversity\\nof practices promoted under open science can serve the reform of\\nresearch(er)
      assessment. However, despite this promising interrelation,\\nboth movements
      risk developing in parallel to one another as long as\\nquestions about the
      aspirations of open science are not discussed with\\nthe affordances of responsible
      research assessment in mind.\\n\\nIndeed, there is ongoing work to illuminate
      these complexities in the\\nform of various European Commission-funded projects.
      How research(er)\\nassessment that considers opens science can play out in practice
      is\\nbeing researched by [GraspOS](https://graspos.eu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      a\\nproject which is concerned with how infrastructures afford the uptake of\\nresearch
      assessment that values open science. The project\\n[OPUS](https://opusproject.eu/about/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      focuses on\\nindicators for the assessment of researchers in the context of
      open\\nscience. [PathOS](https://pathos-project.eu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      tries to\\nbetter understand the impacts of open science. Similarly, the [SUPER\\nMoRRI](https://super-morri.eu/transition-in-science/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nproject
      developed an [evaluation and monitoring\\nframework](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/a-monitoring-and-evaluation-framework-for-responsibility-in-r-i)\\nfor
      responsible research and innovation in Europe that, in many ways,\\nrelates
      to reconfigurations in knowledge production as posited under the\\nbanner of
      open science as well.\\n\\nEarly reflections from these projects and related
      communities can be\\nbrought forward with [Sabina Leonelli's recent book\\n(2023)](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009416368){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      She\\ndescribes open science as backed by a rationale that relies on a strong\\norientation
      towards the sharing of objects of science. These objects do\\nnot necessarily
      describe how research is done, but are themselves\\n(by)products of research,
      including data, publications, models, codes et\\ncetera. In this notion of science,
      *access* to existing scholarship and\\nrelated objects becomes conditional for
      successful open science.\\n\\nIndeed, this notion of open science is widely
      shared and is often\\nreinforced in research(er) assessments that consider open
      science\\nthrough the enrolment of object-oriented knowledge that comes in the\\nform
      of indicators describing e.g., open access outputs. However, these\\nresearch
      assessments only make visible a very narrow interpretation of\\nopenness in
      science and obscure descriptions of how research *is done*\\n-- which is a key
      consideration for recognising and rewarding\\nresearchers on responsible conduct
      of research, transdisciplinary work\\nand other 'broader' interpretations that
      can be found in the\\n[UNESCO](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949/PDF/379949eng.pdf.multi){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nconceptualisation
      of openness; and often remain invisible.\\n\\nThis gives rise to interesting
      questions about capturing immaterial\\nproperties of research, in particular
      when it comes to shared knowledge\\nproduction processes and how they reconfigure
      values and relations or\\nbring up matters of collective concern. These dimensions
      of research are\\nstill widely underrepresented and unaddressed in research(er)\\nassessments
      in the context of (open) science.\\n\\nConclusively, research(er) assessment
      that considers open science is\\nstill in a nascent stage. It is therefore critical
      to collate and\\nexchange experiences of practical attempts to conduct research\\nassessment
      that considers open science. At GraspOS, we will ask these\\nquestions in bimonthly
      online meetings starting 18 October 2023 and\\npresent ongoing stories from
      universities, national funders, thematic\\nresearch clusters to discuss the
      multiple ways in which (responsible)\\nresearch assessment considers open science.\\n\\nWe
      hope to hear stories about issues, frustrations and successes of\\nresearch
      assessment in relation to open science. Finally, the goal of\\nthis community
      is to create a bouquet of stories from which we can learn\\nand draw inspiration
      for our own research assessments. If this is\\nsomething of interest to you,

      institute at Leiden University with a\\ndiverse multinational academic culture.
      PhD candidates, early career\\nresearchers, and visiting scholars from around
      the world gather at CWTS\\nto pursue their research journeys. The journey can
      be an inspiring yet\\nchallenging experience. It might be filled with research,
      innovation,\\nand personal growth, but it can also be a journey that feels isolating\\nat
      times due to the solitary nature of research. Researchers need to\\nspend extended
      periods working alone, which can lead to a sense of\\ndetachment from the broader
      social and academic community. Loneliness\\ncan be particularly challenging
      for our PhD candidates, early career\\nresearchers and visiting researchers
      who have transitioned to a new,\\nunfamiliar environment. To counter this and
      to create a dynamic and\\nsupportive community, in September, we have started
      an Early Career\\nResearcher (ECR) /PhD council with the two of us, Qianqian
      Xie as the\\nChair and Dmitry Kochetkov as a Council member, in the lead.\\n\\n###
      What does it mean to be a PhD candidate or early career researcher?\\n\\nThere
      is more to being a PhD candidate than just obtaining a degree. It\\nassumes
      full involvement in the research process, from generating ideas\\nto implementing
      them practically. The research process includes not only\\nconducting research
      but also actively participating in academic events\\nsuch as seminars, conferences,
      symposia, and round tables. Here, PhD\\ncandidates can exchange experiences
      with peers, discuss their ideas, and\\nbecome familiar with new methods and
      approaches in their field of\\nknowledge.\\n\\nBeing a PhD candidate also entails
      constant self-development and\\nself-education. It is necessary to continuously
      update one\\\\'s knowledge,\\nmonitor new trends and discoveries in their field.
      Ultimately, all of\\nthis contributes to the development of the PhD candidates'
      professional\\nskills, their readiness for independent research activities,
      and\\nsuccessful careers.\\n\\nTo some extent, the same holds true for early
      career researchers -- not\\nonly the PhD candidates. Early career researchers
      are people taking\\ntheir first steps in a academic career. They have a fresh
      and critical\\nview of the world, full of energy and desire to contribute to
      the\\ndevelopment of science. At CWTS, quite a few colleagues are doing\\nresearch
      without following a PhD trajectory. We realized that we need to\\ninclude them
      as well, since some of their struggles are the same.\\n\\nTo provide support
      on the PhD and early career journey, we established\\nthe ECR/PhD Council.\\n\\n###
      What is the ECR/PhD Council?\\n\\nThe ECR/PhD Council is a small, dedicated
      body (currently consisting of\\ntwo members) within CWTS that brings together
      PhDs and early career\\nresearchers. The Council is committed to the promotion
      of internal\\ncommunication, coordination of supportive and networking activities,
      and\\nsocial cohesion within the ECR/ PhD community. At the same time, the\\nCouncil
      is the formal connection between the ECRs and PhDs and the CWTS\\nPhD coordinator
      and the CWTS management board.\\n\\n### What are we planning to do?\\n\\n- Building
      a Supportive Community: Pursuing an ECR/PhD can often feel\\n  like a solitary
      endeavor. The ECR/PhD Council offers a supportive\\n  community where individuals
      can connect, share experiences, and\\n  provide emotional support to one another.
      The Council members also\\n  take the lead in organizing non-academic related
      meetings and informal\\n  ECR/PhD moments, to provide support for the well-being
      and social\\n  needs of individuals beyond their academic pursuits. For instance,\\n
      \ introducing properly new CWTS ECRs/PhD candidates and discussing\\n  challenges
      met during the PhD trajectory. Every two months we will\\n  have informal ECR/PhD
      moments (on-site), including drinks and\\n  pub-quizzes.\\n- Academic Networking
      Opportunities: The Council provides a platform for\\n  networking with peers,
      mentors and potential collaborators, opening\\n  doors to new research opportunities.
      The Council holds monthly ECR/PhD\\n  internal seminars. These meetings will
      be held in hybrid format and in\\n  English to be as inclusive as possible.
      ECRs/PhD candidates may\\n  present and discuss academic work (proposals, results,
      papers,\\n  posters). We are also delighted to announce that the Council hosts\\n
      \ farewell meetings for early career researchers, providing them with\\n  the
      opportunity to present the research they have conducted during\\n  their time
      at CWTS. Of course, this event is not mandatory but highly\\n  encouraged.\\n-
      Buddy system: New CWTS PhD candidates are now offered the opportunity\\n  to
      be paired with a senior CWTS PhD candidate (a 2nd or 3rd year PhD\\n  candidate).
      External PhD candidates will also benefit from this\\n  system.\\n- Providing
      insights to the CWTS Management Board.\\n\\n### What has happened so far?\\n\\nOur
      experience of joining the ECR/PhD Council has been great so far!\\nIt's not
      just about attending meetings and organizing events. It's all\\nabout being
      part of a supportive and dynamic academic community. Here's\\nwhat the experience
      has been like:\\n\\n- Community Building: We've had the opportunity to connect
      with fellow\\n  PhD students and early career researcher from various fields,
      which\\n  has broadened our perspective.\\n- Professional Development: Workshops,
      seminars and resources offered by\\n  the council are sharpening our professional
      skills and broaden our\\n  knowledge base.\\n- Voice and Advocacy: The council
      gives us a platform to voice our needs\\n  and concerns as PhD candidates and
      early career researchers. It's\\n  empowering to know that our interests are
      being represented.\\n- Collaboration and Leadership: We've already been encouraged
      to take on\\n  leadership roles within the council, which we hope will allow
      us to\\n  develop leadership and teamwork skills.\\n\\nOn October 13, 2023,
      ECR/PhD Council held its first welcoming meeting,\\nat which the new PhD candidate
      and a new postdoc had a chance to\\nintroduce their research. The chairman of
      the Council also introduced\\nall issues relevant to do a PhD at CWTS (i.e.
      facilities and services\\noffered to PhDs, PhD trainings and courses, etc.).
      Even though the\\nmeeting took place on Friday, 13 nothing terrible happened.
      On the\\ncontrary, the meeting was held in a warm, friendly atmosphere.  \\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Welcoming-event-photo.png\\\"\\nalt=\\\"Welcoming

      the meeting, the council prepared food for all participants, and\\none of our
      colleagues even taught others how to roll spring rolls. It\\nwas not only a
      fascinating cultural experience but also an excellent way\\nto strengthen relationships.

      global challenges we should\\nbe attentive to what is at the core of science:
      the attribution of value\\nto numerical or qualitative values such as counting,
      classifying and\\nevaluating physical and societal phenomena. This also holds
      for the\\npractice of governing science. Science policy articulates particular\\nkinds
      of future (e.g. environmental or societal outcomes) that are\\nconsidered either
      desirable or unattractive, and it ascribes particular\\nroles and values to
      science in the making of these futures. This raises\\nimportant questions about
      the values attributed to scientific expertise\\nand policy making in relation
      to sustainable futures, and the role and\\nagency of science and policy in shaping
      sustainable futures.\\n\\nIn an attempt to address these questions, we hosted
      [a two-day workshop\\non 13 and 14 June\\n2023](https://www.fluid-knowledge.com/workhop){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      as part\\nof the\\n[FluidKnowledge](https://www.fluid-knowledge.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nproject
      of Sarah de Rijcke. We gathered a variety of academics\\nreflecting on doing
      science in times of climate breakdown. Participants\\nsubmitted contributions
      that covered different topics including but not\\nlimited to biodiversity modelling
      for sustainable financing, sustainable\\nagriculture, deep sea mining and nature
      conservation. The variety of\\ntopics provided different angles to reflect upon
      roles and practices at\\nthe interface between science policy and scientific
      expertise, and how\\nscientists position themselves in their research. Although
      many relevant\\nconcepts were discussed for each contribution, we would like
      here to\\nhighlight two common themes: Power and Plurality. Both concepts\\nmaterialized
      in various forms and contexts and made the bridge between\\nthe different contributions.
      The combination of Power and Plurality made\\nus, during the workshop, reflect
      upon our own position as researchers.  \\n\\n### Power, Plurality, and the Position
      of the research(er)\\n\\nWe started the workshop with two contributions addressing
      climate and\\nbiodiversity modelling. Power materializes in modelling practices
      when\\nmodellers navigate the powerfulness of climate and biodiversity scenario\\nmodels
      in shaping policies and futures. Biodiversity and climate models\\nare often
      developed by scientific institutions to project biodiversity\\nand climate patterns.
      However, their power extends beyond the scientific\\ninstitutions when they
      are applied to, for example, inform\\ndecision-making in sustainable financing
      or global policy-making. In\\nthese translation processes from science to environmental\\ndecision-making
      the political, social and ethical dimensions come into\\nplay. The plurality
      of perspectives present in these dimensions are\\n*not* integrated in the original
      models. Nevertheless, the models and\\nthe knowledge models create *are* used
      in high level decision-making and\\nserve therefore as a powerful tool that
      scientific institutions should\\ntake into account in their model designs.\\n\\nWhen
      zooming out, we touched upon the powerful organizational forms of\\nwhat is
      valued as 'useful science', which is now dominated by the\\n(Western) techno
      economic paradigms that steer green technology\\ntransitions. A good example
      of the power of this paradigm is the demands\\nit puts on governments, companies,
      and researchers to explore the deep\\nseabed for minerals like cobalt to support
      a sustainable future. We\\ntouched upon deep sea research that seem to be trapped
      into a power\\ngrab, controlled by (inter)national governments and industry
      to generate\\nknowledge on the environmental impacts of deep-sea mining useful
      for\\ncompanies and policy-making at international levels. In relation to\\nthat,
      the importance of disinterestedness of researchers in this space\\nis highly
      valued by most actors involved. As a result, this means that\\neyebrows are
      being raised when researchers cooperate with industry or,\\nalternatively, when
      researchers tend to take radical views against deep\\nsea mining. Is it, as
      scientists, justifiable to step away from the\\nimportance of being detached
      and disinterested, and actively choose\\nsides?\\n\\n### Whose side are we on?\\n\\n'Whose
      side are we on' as researchers was vividly highlighted when\\ndiscussing a contribution
      on the co-creation of knowledge for nature\\nconservation in South Africa. The
      pressure put on scientists to engage\\nwith the variety of social actors that
      work in South African nature\\nparks stems from the belief that this would increase
      the effectiveness\\nof implementing conservation policies and empower local
      communities.\\nHowever, based on experiences with research projects on transfrontier\\nwildlife
      management and private game farming, we discussed whether\\nknowledge co-creation
      can also be counterproductive for empowering\\nmarginalized communities. This
      could be the case when powerful actors\\nlike non-profit organizations or wildlife
      managers try to silence\\nmarginalized communities through discrediting researchers
      and\\ndelegitimizing other types of knowledges and perspectives. Instead of\\ndisengaging,
      detaching, and staying independent from these power\\ndynamics, researchers
      might have to choose positions when engaging in\\nthese types of socio-ecological
      issues.\\n\\nBy the end of a fruitful and constructive workshop discussion,
      we were\\nleft with more questions than answers to reflect upon. The discussions\\nand
      diversity of topics that were addressed in the context of doing\\nscience in
      times of climate breakdown led us to reflect on who's side we\\nare on as researchers
      ourselves. This includes the question of what we\\ncan potentially do (more
      of) or should stop doing within our research\\nand beyond to address global
      challenges. What does it actually mean to\\nbe a scientist in this world? Should
      we politicize science, take (very)\\ncritical views on what is happening, stand
      up from the relatively\\ncomfortable science studies armchair and dive in?\\n\\nWhat

      paper presents a systematic review of existing literature on\\nrankings in the
      context of research evaluation and excellence\\ninitiatives. English-language
      sources primarily constitute the basis of\\nthis review, although additional
      coverage is given to literature from\\nRussia, where the significance of rankings
      in the national policy was\\nemphasized in the title and objective of the policy
      project 5top100 (the\\nreview covers only a relatively small part of Russian-language\\nliterature
      on rankings; an extended study of the Russian academic\\nliterature is available\\n[here](https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9gdy2){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\nFurthermore,
      gray literature has also been included for a comprehensive\\nunderstanding of
      the topic.\\n\\n### **The attitudes towards university rankings and their use
      in research evaluation in academic and gray literature**\\n\\nThe literature
      analysis reveals a prevailing academic consensus that\\nrankings should not
      be employed as a sole measure of research assessment\\nand indicators of the
      national policies. Rankings can be used for\\nmarketing and benchmarking functions,
      but in a responsible way by\\nrecognizing their limitations. Various authors
      have highlighted\\ntechnical and methodological flaws, biases of different nature\\n(including
      biased evaluation of both universities and individual\\nresearchers), conflicts
      of interest, and risks to national identity.\\nCriticism is mainly focused on
      rankings that use a composite indicator\\nas a single overall measure of university
      performance (QS, THE, and\\nARWU). Rather few studies demonstrate a positive
      or neutral attitude\\ntowards global university rankings. The key findings from
      the literature\\nare summarized in the diagram below.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Picture1.jpg\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"35814\\\"
      />\\n<figcaption>Figure 1: Map of views on global university rankings and\\ntheir
      use in research evaluation</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n  \\nIt is noteworthy
      to observe that the perception of global university\\nrankings in gray publications
      has undergone a substantial evolution.\\nDuring the 2000s and early 2010s, there
      existed a favorable outlook on\\nuniversity rankings, with policymakers and
      certain academics endorsing\\ntheir use to gauge the excellence of higher education
      institutions on a\\nglobal scale, to some extent. In recent years, there has
      been a\\ndiscernible shift in the perspective in the gray literature towards\\nuniversity
      rankings, becoming more inclined towards a critical view.\\n\\n### Rankings
      and research evaluation in the Russian science system\\n\\nRankings played an
      incredibly significant role in Russian national\\npolicy. In 2013-2020, the
      Russian government implemented the 5top100\\nproject aimed at getting five Russian
      universities into the top 100 of\\nglobal university rankings. The goal of the
      project was not achieved,\\nbut some experts noted positive changes, primarily
      an increase in the\\nnumber of publications by Russian universities. The 5top100
      project was\\ncontinued within the framework of the [Priority-2030\\nprogram](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/priority-2030-the-new-excellence-initiative-from-russia){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThis
      ongoing policy initiative is also aimed at promoting the\\ndevelopment and advancement
      of national universities. One distinct\\naspect of this program is its rejection
      of global university rankings as\\nthe sole basis of evaluation. By moving away
      from a narrow reliance on\\nglobal rankings, the program aims to foster a more
      holistic and\\ncontext-specific approach to assessing the performance and progress
      of\\nRussian universities. However, a considerable proportion of evaluation\\nin
      Priority-2030 still depends on quantitative indicators also used in\\nthe methodologies
      of global university rankings, in particular the\\nscoring of publications based
      on the indexing of journals in Scopus or\\nWeb of Science.\\n\\nDespite the
      [rosy\\nreports](https://ach.gov.ru/statements/byulleten-schetnoy-palaty-2-279-2021-g){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nof
      Russian universities moving up in the rankings and increasing their\\npublications,
      it suddenly turned out that the country did not have\\nenough technological
      competencies to [produce car\\npaint](https://www.forbes.ru/biznes/484319-avtovaz-peresel-na-vypusk-lada-v-treh-cvetah-iz-za-deficita-kraski){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nor

      situation appears to be even more concerning when examining the\\nanalysis of
      ranking positions for 28 Russian universities that sought\\nconsulting services
      from Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) between 2016 and 2021\\n(see [the analysis by
      Igor\\nChirikov](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10734-022-00942-5){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\nThe
      findings revealed an unusual increase in ranking positions that\\ncould not
      be justified by any observable changes in the universities\\\\'\\ncharacteristics,
      as indicated by national statistics. This phenomenon,\\ntermed \\\\\\\"self-bias\\\\\\\"
      by the author, raises questions about the validity\\nof these rankings. It is
      worth noting that in the latest edition of the\\nQS ranking, all Russian universities
      experienced a significant decline\\nin their positions. This begs the question:
      were Russian universities\\nperforming well previously, and has there been a
      noticeable\\ndeterioration in their activities lately? Overall, it is my belief
      that\\nrelying solely on university rankings cannot provide a reliable answer\\nto
      these inquiries.\\n\\nBack to the literature review, I must admit that the scope
      of topics\\ncovered in Russian-language literature regarding rankings is remarkably\\nlimited,
      with the dominant theme revolving around competitiveness.\\nFurthermore, there
      is a striking lack of overlap between academic and\\ngray literature in Russian
      compared to English-language sources. In\\nfact, the only point of intersection
      is the neo-colonial discourse,\\nwhich considers rankings as a tool for promoting
      the Western model of\\nhigher education. Some authors also point out the difference
      between the\\nWestern and Russian model of higher education, for instance, [Lazar\\n(2019)](http://dx.doi.org/10.33933/2074-2762-2019-54-134-144){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nIn
      Western countries, science and higher education have traditionally\\ncoexisted
      within universities, with applied research being actively\\ndeveloped through
      the participation of businesses. In contrast, in\\nRussia, since the times of
      the USSR, there has been a \\\\\\\"research triad\\\\\\\"\\nconsisting of the
      Academy of Sciences, industry design bureaus, and\\nresearch institutes, while
      universities and industry institutes have\\nprimarily focused on personnel training
      with government funding. As a\\nresult, both fundamental and applied research
      has historically been\\nlargely conducted outside of universities in Russia.\\n\\nThe
      topic of responsible research evaluation is poorly developed in\\nRussia. Regrettably,
      this indicates the isolated nature of Russian\\nscience and educational policy
      debates, which obviously hampers the\\nprospects for development.\\n\\n### What
      to do in this situation?\\n\\nI believe the problem described above concerns
      not only Russia. Although\\nthe degree of influence is different, the rankings
      continue to shape\\nnational and institutional strategies in higher education
      practically\\nall over the world.\\n\\nI have emphasized the inherent complexity
      of dismissing rankings\\noutright since they continue to serve as effective
      marketing tools.\\nHaving said that, I must also acknowledge the complexity
      of cultural\\nchange. Even now [some people\\nbelieve](https://doi.org/10.22363/2313-2272-2022-22-4-909-918){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nthat
      university rankings measure the international prestige of the\\ncountry *\\\"based
      on the objective assessment by experts from different\\ncountries of the significant
      achievements of universities.\\\"*\\n\\nA [recent report by the Universities
      of the\\nNetherlands](https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/en_GB/nieuws-detail/nieuwsbericht/915-p-dutch-universities-to-take-different-approach-to-rankings-p.html){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nproposed
      a strategy deal with university rankings in more responsible\\nways. This entails
      the implementation of initiatives at three levels. In\\nthe short term, universities
      should embark on individual initiatives. In\\nthe medium term, coordinated initiatives
      should be undertaken at the\\nnational level, such as collaborative efforts
      by all universities in the\\nNetherlands. In the longer term, coordinated initiatives
      are to be set\\nup at the international level.\\n\\nAt present, I would suggest
      focusing on several specific stops:\\n\\n- Stop evaluating academics based on
      university ranking indicators.\\n  Start rewarding the contributions of faculty
      and researchers in all\\n  areas of university activities.\\n- Stop constructing
      university strategies based on university rankings.\\n  Do not use ranking tiers
      in analytical reports for management decision\\n  making; instead, focus on
      the actual contributions made by a\\n  university (scientific, educational,
      and societal).\\n- Stop evaluating universities based on ranking indicators.
      Every\\n  university has a unique mission, and only fulfillment of this mission\\n
      \ really matters.\\n- Stop using ranking information in national strategies
      and other kinds\\n  of ambitions. Only universities' contributions to national
      and global\\n  goals should be considered.\\n- Stop paying money for consulting
      services to ranking compliers. This\\n  is a pure conflict of interests.\\n\\nHowever,
      the change starts with each of us. Every time that we say or\\npost in social
      media something like \\\"My university has advanced N\\npositions in ranking
      X\\\", this adds to the validity of rankings in the\\neyes of potential customers.
      By refraining from making such statements,\\nevery member of academic community
      can contribute to reducing the\\nharmful impact of rankings.\\n\\n[**  \\nCompeting

      of social media: trust and moderation. Social media plays\\nan increasing role
      in societal debates, and we have a special interest\\nin understanding [the
      role of science in such\\ndebates](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/monitoring-the-dissemination-of-covid-19-related-scientific-publications-in-online-media).\\nSocial
      media suffer from various problematic aspects. There are concerns\\nof the [spread
      of\\nmisinformation](https://www.science.org/content/article/fake-news-spreads-faster-true-news-twitter-thanks-people-not-bots){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nconcerns
      of large swaths of [bots and \\\"fake\\\"\\naccounts](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03034-5){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nand
      of [attacks on individual\\nusers](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/19/its-the-era-of-the-twitter-pile-on-isnt-there-something-healthier-we-can-do-with-our-rage){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nAlthough
      social media have increasingly tried to deal with this, it\\nremains a rather
      daunting task.  \\n\\nAddressing problems of trust and moderation requires more
      than just\\ndecentralised social media. At the moment, many Mastodon servers
      are run\\nby volunteers, and [some servers reached their\\nlimits](https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-users-mastodon-meltdown/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nunder
      the strain of the millions of users migrating from Twitter to\\nMastodon recently.
      Although such volunteer activity is supported by\\ngenerous donations, this
      is unlikely to scale to the hundreds of\\nmillions of Twitter users. Moderation
      is also run by volunteers, and\\nscaling this to many millions of users is very
      challenging, running into\\nexactly the same problems that Twitter and Facebook
      are facing. These\\nestablished social media employ\\n[hundreds](https://gizmodo.com/twitter-content-moderation-musk-midterms-1849726968){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nor
      even\\n[thousands](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/08/1002894/facebook-needs-30000-of-its-own-content-moderators-says-a-new-report/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nof
      moderators, while problematic messages keep flowing through the\\ncracks. Moreover,
      moderation should not be in the hands of the few, and\\nTwitter or Facebook
      should not unilaterally get to decide for the world\\nwhat should be allowed
      and what should not.  \\n\\n### Host server\\n\\nWe propose that institutions
      should step up and take responsibility and\\nhost their own servers. Institutions,
      like universities, research\\ncentres, newspapers, publishers, broadcast companies,
      ministries and\\nNGOs, all have a role to play in shaping the discussion on
      social media,\\nwithout any single institution being in control. We believe
      that\\ninstitutions setting up their own servers brings three benefits.\\n\\nFirst,
      by hosting their own servers, institutions contribute to trust\\nand verification
      of users. Many institutions already have established\\nand verified domain names,
      such as\\n[cwts.nl](https://www.cwts.nl/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} for our own\\ninstitution,
      and this helps to establish a trusted presence on social\\nmedia. Within the
      federated social media, accounts would be clearly\\nassociated with that domain
      name, for example\\n[@vtraag@social.cwts.nl](https://social.cwts.nl/@vtraag){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nclearly
      establishing that these users belong to that institution.\\nInstitutions can
      limit users to staff members only and verify their\\nidentity, thus establishing
      a trusted presence. Users may benefit from\\nthe institutional connection, and
      as some have argued, this could\\nestablish an organisation as [a trustworthy\\nbrand](https://martinfowler.com/articles/your-org-run-mastodon.html){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nmaking
      Mastodon a more suitable platform for institutions than Twitter,\\n[instead
      of\\nless](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2022/11/10/academics-can-easily-leave-twitters-town-square-but-it-will-be-much-harder-for-their-institutions/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      \ \\n\\nSecondly, institutions with their own servers would contribute to the\\nmoderation
      of social media. Institutions need to take responsibility for\\nmoderating the
      behaviour of users of their own server. This means that\\ninstitutions should
      implement a clear moderation policy for their social\\nmedia presence. This
      is how it should be: different contexts may require\\ndifferent moderation policies.
      For example, researchers may have\\ndifferent obligations and responsibilities
      than the general public. This\\nway, institutions could help ensure that debates
      take place more\\nrespectfully. At the same time, institutions would also help
      to ensure\\nthat people are able to express themselves freely and safely.  \\n\\nThirdly,
      establishing institutional servers makes decentralised social\\nmedia sustainable.
      As we already noted, it is unlikely that the current\\nsystem will scale to
      millions of people based on voluntary\\ncontributions. By stepping up and providing
      their own servers,\\ninstitutions provide a critical part of the necessary infrastructure.\\nNot
      only in monetary terms, but also in terms of time investment for\\nverification
      and moderation.  \\n\\n### CWTS initiative\\n\\nThis is why at CWTS we have
      now launched our own social media server at\\n[social.cwts.nl](https://social.cwts.nl){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      Only people\\nwho are affiliated with CWTS can register for an account on this
      server.\\nIn practice, this means that CWTS staff members can register for an\\naccount
      using their institutional email address. We have written a\\nmoderation policy,
      and set up a moderation committee that will advise on\\nany violations of this
      moderation policy to the management. The\\nmanagement would not moderate messages
      directly, and only rely on the\\nmoderation committee, thus providing some necessary
      checks and balances.\\nWe trust CWTS staff members to behave responsibly in
      accordance with\\nthis moderation policy. We will not actively check every message
      being\\nposted, but reported messages will be followed up on.  \\n\\nDoes this
      initiative solve all problems of social media? Surely not.\\nInstitutional users
      presumably represent only a small minority of social\\nmedia users. How the
      large public will find its way on Mastodon is not\\nyet clear. This initiative
      will not directly reduce societal\\npolarisation, but it may help establish
      a trusted social media presence\\nof researchers who can engage in societal
      debates. It also expands the\\nbreadth of social media platforms that researchers
      can use to interact\\nwith broader communities. We believe that setting up our
      own server is a\\nstep forward, and we hope to see other institutions taking
      similar\\ninitiatives.  \\n\",\"published_at\":1670414400,\"updated_at\":1708703227,\"indexed_at\":1708118022,\"authors\":[{\"name\":

      introduced the CWTS knowledge agenda 2023-2028. Building on this, in\\nthe current
      post we present the new focal areas in which CWTS organizes\\nits activities.
      These focal areas address key challenges in the way\\nscience is practiced and
      governed, in particular challenges for which we\\nbelieve our centre is uniquely
      positioned to make a difference and to\\ncontribute to transformative changes.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/20230509-focal-areas-of-CWTS.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"34092\\\"
      alt=\\\"The focal areas of CWTS\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\n### Focal areas\\n\\nMost
      of our activities at CWTS take place in three focal areas:\\nEngagement & Inclusion,
      Evaluation & Culture, and Information &\\nOpenness. These focal areas were launched
      on January 1, 2023, replacing\\nthe three research groups in which CWTS was
      organized until the end of\\n2022. While the research groups represented disciplinary
      traditions in\\nscience studies research, the focal areas are organized around
      key\\nchallenges faced by the research system. This reflects a major shift in\\nour
      way of working at CWTS.\\n\\nEach focal area consists of a core group of about
      eight to ten senior\\nstaff members and a broader group of PhD candidates and
      other\\nearly-career staff members as well as visiting researchers. A focal
      area\\nhas a small coordinating team that includes both senior researchers and\\na
      colleague with expertise in project coordination. To benefit from\\nsynergies
      between the focal areas, several staff members are\\ncontributing to two areas.\\n\\nThe
      box below summarizes the topics addressed by the focal areas. While\\neach focal
      area covers a distinct set of problems, the areas are also\\nclosely interconnected.
      The selection of the topics addressed by the\\nfocal areas is the outcome of
      an intensive consultative process\\ninvolving the entire CWTS team. By focusing
      on these topics, we aim to\\nset clear priorities and to maximize the impact
      of our work. The\\nimportance of setting priorities was emphasized in the evaluation
      of our\\ncentre that took place last year. In its advice, the evaluation\\ncommittee
      also identified topics that it felt may deserve more attention\\nin the work
      of our centre. The suggestions made by the committee have\\nproven very useful
      in defining the focal areas.  \\n\\n::: {style=\\\"background-color: #f3f3f3;
      padding:10px;\\\"}\\n#### Engagement & Inclusion {#engagement-inclusion style=\\\"width:100%;
      text-align:center;\\\"}\\n\\nThe focal area *Engagement & Inclusion* aims to
      contribute to a more\\ncollaborative, engaged, and inclusive research system.
      We believe in\\npromoting diversity and inclusion in the global scientific workforce,\\nand
      in recognizing the essential role that communication and co-creation\\nof scholarly
      activities play in strengthening such a diverse system. The\\nfocal area approaches
      these questions through strategic ambitions around\\nthe three pillars of the
      CWTS knowledge agenda: *understanding*,\\n*intervening*, and *practicing*. Examples
      of such ambitions include\\nimproving our understanding of the role of epistemic
      diversity in\\nknowledge creation, developing policy recommendations for more
      inclusive\\nand diverse academic careers, and taking more proactive measures
      to\\nco-create our own activities with a larger variety of societal\\nstakeholders
      (e.g., NGOs, educational organizations, and citizens).\\n\\n#### Evaluation
      & Culture {#evaluation-culture style=\\\"width:100%; text-align:center;\\\"}\\n\\nThe
      focal area *Evaluation & Culture* is concerned with the many\\ndifferent ways
      in which research is evaluated, for instance through\\nassessment of research
      institutions and individual researchers, and\\nthrough peer review in publishing
      and funding contexts. Recognizing the\\nmutual shaping of research and research
      evaluation, we are committed to\\npromoting forms of evaluation that are suited
      to diverse knowledge\\nmaking practices and that foster healthy and inclusive
      academic working\\nenvironments. The focal area combines activities in the *understanding*,\\n*intervening*,
      and *practicing* pillars of the CWTS knowledge agenda. We\\nwant to better understand
      how research evaluation in its many forms\\nconditions research agendas, notions
      of quality, and daily practices of\\nresearch and scholarly communication. In
      addition, we aim to use our\\ninsights to promote positive change, for example
      by advising\\ninstitutions like universities and funding bodies on how to organize\\nevaluation
      for epistemic and social inclusivity, diversity, and\\nopenness. Lastly, we
      aim to practice our values by constantly reflecting\\non how we do evaluation
      in our immediate working environment.\\n\\n#### Information & Openness {#information-openness
      style=\\\"width:100%; text-align:center;\\\"}\\n\\nThe focal area *Information
      & Openness* is concerned with studying and\\nadvancing openness of research
      information, such as information about\\nthe activities and outputs of researchers
      and research institutions. We\\nbelieve that openness of research information
      can play an important role\\nin fostering responsible research assessment practices
      and promoting\\nglobal inclusiveness in science. The activities of the focal
      area\\nrevolve around the *understanding*, *intervening*, and *practicing*\\npillars
      of the CWTS knowledge agenda. We aim to develop a deep\\nunderstanding of the
      open research information landscape and to monitor\\nthe openness of research
      information. We also intend to develop\\ninitiatives that promote openness of
      research information as the norm\\nfor scientometric analyses. In addition,
      we are putting the use of open\\nresearch information into practice in our own
      work. The work of CWTS\\nwill increasingly be based on open rather than closed
      research\\ninformation, making our work more transparent, reproducible, and\\ninclusive.\\n:::\\n\\n###
      Strategic ambitions\\n\\nThe focal areas are currently developing strategic
      ambitions for the\\nperiod 2023-2028. Each focal area organizes its strategic
      ambitions in\\nthree pillars:\\n\\n- ***Understanding:*** Ambitions that focus
      on developing a deeper\\n  understanding of the problems addressed in the focal
      area.\\n\\n- ***Intervening:*** Ambitions that contribute to improving the research\\n
      \ system, for instance through Horizon Europe projects, products and\\n  services
      of [CWTS BV](https://www.cwtsbv.nl/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}, and\\n  also through
      training, advocacy, and contributions to policy making.\\n\\n- ***Practicing:***
      Ambitions that contribute to improving our own way\\n  of working at CWTS ('practice
      what we preach').\\n\\nWhile a research centre may traditionally be expected
      to focus primarily\\non *understanding*, for our centre\_*intervening* is of
      equal importance.\\nAs discussed in [our previous blog\\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-knowledge-agenda-2023-2028),\\nthe
      mission of CWTS is to improve how science is practiced and governed\\nand how
      it serves society. Realizing this mission requires us to invest\\nour efforts
      both in *understanding* and in *intervening*. In addition,\\nrecognizing that
      we are part of the research system ourselves, we also\\nfeel a special responsibility
      to improve our own way of working by\\n*practicing* what we preach, for instance
      in areas such as [open\\nscience](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/practicing-what-we-preach-our-journey-toward-open-science)\\nand
      [recognition and\\nrewards](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/responsible-research-culture-practicing-what-we-preach-at-cwts).\\n\\nAt
      the moment the focal areas are working hard to finalize the\\ndevelopment of
      their strategic ambitions in the *understanding*,\\n*intervening*, and *practicing*
      pillars. They expect to announce their\\nplans in the coming months.  \\n\\n###
      Next steps\\n\\nThe focal areas, along with new ambitions in the *understanding*,\\n*intervening*,
      and *practicing* pillars, represent a major change in our\\nway of working at
      CWTS. The full implementation of these key elements in\\nthe CWTS knowledge
      agenda 2023-2028 will take time. We therefore see\\n2023 and 2024 as a transition
      period in which the knowledge agenda will\\nbe further elaborated and fine-tuned
      and in which the introduction of a\\nnew way of working at our centre will be
      completed.\\n\\nWe expect that the Leiden Madtrics blog will be used to provide
      further\\nupdates on the development of the knowledge agenda and the focal areas.\\nKeep
      an eye on future blog posts!\\n\\n*We thank the focal area coordinators for
      preparing the brief\\ndescriptions of the focal areas presented in this blog

      above text, we identify three main types of acknowledgment:\\n\\n- [Personal
      acknowledgment:]{style=\\\"color:blue;\\\"} Individuals being\\n  acknowledged
      for their roles in the research process\\n- [Financial support:]{style=\\\"color:green;\\\"}
      Reference to grants,\\n  contracts, or any phrasing that elucidates the financial
      component of\\n  the acknowledgment (terms like \\\"funded\\\", \\\"financially

      Reference to the use\\n  of facilities, materials and/or machines used in the
      research process\\n\\nWhen bibliometric databases count funding acknowledgments,
      it is\\nimportant to accurately make the above distinctions, since different\\nanalyses
      require inclusion and exclusion of different acknowledgment\\ntypes. This can
      already be difficult to ascertain when the wording in\\nthe acknowledgment text
      is ambiguous (i.e., is \\\"Author A was supported\\nby Harvard\\\" a financial
      acknowledgment?) or when the logistic support\\ncomes with a grant or contract
      number.\\n\\nThat latter distinction, between grant and contract, is important
      to\\nnote on its own terms:\\n\\n- **Grant**: in referencing [grant 0655133B
      from the American Heart\\n  Association]{style=\\\"color:green;\\\"}, the authors

      Association |\\n:::\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\nWhen comparing these results with the
      original acknowledgment text, the\\ndifferent databases clearly exhibit varying
      degrees of accuracy.\\n\\nDimensions and Scopus provide the most comprehensive
      results,\\nidentifying financial support from both the US Department of Energy
      and\\nthe American Heart Association. In comparison, Web of Science only\\nidentifies
      the US Department of Energy and Crossref only identifies the\\nAmerican Heart
      Association.\\n\\nIn addition to this, the results from Dimensions also list
      the Argonne\\nNational Laboratory which is not mentioned in the acknowledgment
      text.\\nAfter further investigation it was found that the Advanced Photon Source\\nis
      located at Argonne National Laboratory. This is a complicated case\\nprecisely
      because it can be partly categorized as logistical support\\n(\\\"Use of the
      Advanced Photon Source\\\") and partly financial (the\\nmentioned contract).
      However, we would argue that having the Argonne\\nNational Laboratory as the
      funder here is debatable since the funding\\nthat is in play here is from the
      US Department of Energy *to* the\\nArgonne National Laboratory. Arguably, the
      support from Argonne National\\nLaboratory is logistical, while the support
      from the US Department of\\nEnergy is financial yet of a more indirect type
      than the American Heart\\nAssociation.\\n\\nFurthermore, there is also a variability
      in the identification of grant\\nnumbers by the different databases. Web of
      Science and Scopus only find\\na grant number for the US Department of Energy,
      whereas Dimensions and\\nCrossref only find a grant number for the American
      Heart Association.\\n\\n### Extracting and identifying funding acknowledgements\\n\\nThe
      variation in the results can be partly explained by the different\\napproaches
      taken by the databases for the extraction and identification\\nof funding acknowledgment
      data.\\n\\n[Web of Science extracts and\\ndisplays](http://wokinfo.com/products_tools/multidisciplinary/webofscience/fundingsearch/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nthe
      raw (source) text from the acknowledgment text, while Dimensions\\nonly displays
      the resulting assignment to an organization in the [GRID\\ndatabase](https://www.grid.ac/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      it uses. To end up with\\nthis assignment, [Dimensions uses a\\ncombination](https://plus.dimensions.ai/support/solutions/articles/23000018861-what-is-the-difference-between-funded-by-and-supporting-grants-shown-on-a-publication-page-){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nof
      \\\"text-mining the 'Acknowledgments' or 'Funding' section\\\" and\\n\\\"structured
      metadata received from some of our publication data sources,\\ne.g., Crossref
      or PubMed\\\".\\n\\nThe [funder registry used by\\nCrossref](https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nwas
      donated by Elsevier, and is combined with acknowledgment and grant\\ninformation
      provided to Crossref by publishers and funding agencies in\\norder to connect
      the funders in the registry to publications. Scopus\\nextracts organizations
      from the acknowledgment text and [matches them to\\nthe Crossref funding\\nregistry](https://www.elsevier.com/research-intelligence/research-initiatives/funder-registry){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nThese
      methodological differences can result in the potential loss of\\ndiscerning
      information regarding the identification of funding\\norganizations. For example,
      in the acknowledgment text the reference to\\nthe US Department of Energy consists
      of three parts: the funding agency\\n(US Department of Energy), the funding
      programme (Basic Energy Sciences)\\nand the programme office (Office of Science).\\n\\nWeb
      of Science identifies this information as one funder, including the\\nhierarchical
      structure of the organization within the name. In\\ncomparison, Scopus lists
      these different levels as separate\\norganizations, resulting in the identification
      of three funders where\\nthere should only be one.\\n\\nIt is also important
      to note that the relationships between the\\norganizations are not documented
      within the funding registry created by\\nWeb of Science. The hierarchical relationships
      between different\\norganizations are available within the Crossref and GRID
      registries used\\nby the other databases, allowing organizations to be aggregated
      into\\nhigher-level entities.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThese types of discrepancies
      in funding acknowledgments are not rare.\\nThe standards and practices of what
      or whom to acknowledge [vary\\ndepending on the field of\\nstudy,](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0185578){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nwith
      [cultural\\nfactors](https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.22692){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      also\\nplaying a role.\\n\\nThe above example illustrates certain nuances that
      one needs to be aware\\nof when analyzing funding acknowledgment databases;
      each database\\ncaptures and interprets the data differently and the exact nature
      of the\\nacknowledgment is not always obvious. Moreover, it also shows that\\ncounting
      acknowledgments is not a straightforward task, with one paper\\nresulting in
      either 1, 2, 3 or 4 acknowledgments depending on which\\nbibliographic database
      you refer to.\\n\\nIt would be helpful if bibliographic data providers were
      more\\nforthcoming on the decision processes that lie behind such results as\\nshown
      above. How do they distinguish funding acknowledgments from other\\ntypes of
      acknowledgments? Why do they include certain mentioned\\norganizations in the
      text and ignore others? For some data providers, it\\nis also not clear whether
      the connected funder is extracted from the\\ntext or derived from other sources,
      such as data provided by the\\npublisher or funder. Here, too, transparency
      would be helpful for those\\nusing the data.\\n\\nFinally, though one standardized
      format of writing acknowledgments could\\nnever fit every case, as mentioned
      in the [previous\\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/to-count-or-not-to-count-how-to-deal-with-funding-acknowledgements){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nusing
      [persistent\\nidentifiers](https://www.nwo.nl/en/news/nwo-persistent-identifier-strategy-will-lead-increased-efficiency-and-insight){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      templates provided by funders can help to streamline the processing\\nof this
      data.\\n\\n*Part 2 of the series on Funding Acknowledgements in Academic\\nPublishing*\\n\\n*Photo

      has gained significant momentum over the past few years,\\nwith various movements
      and initiatives emerging to promote sharing of\\nscientific knowledge, data,
      and resources with the wider community. Open\\nscience is a broad term encompassing
      a range of practices that strive to\\nincrease transparency, inclusivity, and
      accessibility in science. The\\nexpected benefits of open science are manifold,
      from accelerating\\nscientific progress, enhancing scientific rigour, promoting
      responsible\\nresearch, and ensuring public trust in science.\\n\\nWith that
      in mind, the research councils of the Netherlands (NWO) and\\nNorway (RCN) joined
      hands with CWTS to organize a seminar series on open\\nscience throughout 2022.
      The seminars aimed to enrich and expand the\\nunderstanding of open science
      within the agencies, focusing on programme\\nand policy officers and connected
      professionals interested in the\\nsubject.\\n\\nAware of the challenges to reaching
      all those interested within NWO and\\nRCN, we decided to create a knowledge
      platform to store and share the\\ncontent from the seminars so they could be
      attended asynchronously.\\nMoreover, recognizing the value of the produced content
      to a broader\\naudience, we decided to put the idea of openness into practice,
      making\\nthe platform open to the public.\\n\\n### [**The knowledge platform**](https://open-science.cwts.nl/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nThe
      knowledge platform features videos from the seminar series\\npresentations,
      including lectures from Thed van Leeuwen, Ludo Waltman,\\nWolfgang Kaltenbrunner,
      and myself. Open science champions, as we call\\nthe many experts that shared
      experiences and their perspectives with our\\naudience, are also there. Additionally,
      the platform includes support\\nmaterials, access to the slides used in our
      presentations, links to\\nrelevant resources and literature, and more.\\n\\nThe
      seminar series consisted of four individual seminars, included as\\ndifferent
      sections in the platform. Each one of them covered specific\\naspects of open
      science:\\n\\n#### [*Introduction to open science*](https://open-science.cwts.nl/introduction/introduction-to-os-five-schools-of-open-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nThe
      first seminar provided an overview of the complexity of open science\\nas more
      of an umbrella term than a well-defined concept. From that\\nperspective, open
      science refers to a series of movements to remove\\nbarriers to sharing any
      scientific output, resources, methods, or tools\\nand bringing scientific results
      closer to the general public. Through a\\nseries of examples, we adopted the
      model of five schools of thought\\nproposed by [Fecher and\\nFriesike](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-00026-8_2){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n(2014)
      to understand open science in its multiple dimensions, from being\\ndemocratic
      to its role in recognition and rewards.\\n\\n#### *[Open scholarly communication](https://open-science.cwts.nl/introduction/open-scholarly-communication){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}*\\n\\nThe
      second seminar delved into open scholarly communication. It covered\\ntopics
      such as open access publishing, article processing charges\\n(APCs), Plan S,
      pre-printing, and open peer review. The seminar also\\ncovered newer forms of
      scholarly publishing, with diverse levels of\\nopenness, and the transition
      towards a more democratic future in\\nscience.\\n\\n#### [*Open data, software
      and infrastructures*](https://open-science.cwts.nl/introduction/open-data-software-and-infrastructures){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nThe
      third seminar focused on aspects connected to the infrastructure\\nschool of
      open science, including open data, how to make data FAIR\\n(Findable, Accessible,
      Interoperable, and Reusable), and data management\\nplans, as well as recent
      developments in the sharing of code and\\nsoftware. The seminar also covered
      necessary infrastructures for open\\nscience, such as repositories.\\n\\n####
      [*Recognition & rewards and responsible research assessment*](https://open-science.cwts.nl/introduction/recognition-and-rewards-and-responsible-research-assessment){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      {#recognition-rewards-and-responsible-research-assessment}\\n\\nThe fourth seminar
      approached an important ongoing development in the\\nacademic world, connecting
      openness to issues related to recognition &\\nrewards and responsible research
      assessment. The seminar covered the\\ncurrent state of those issues and the
      challenges that arise from them.\\nIt also discussed responsible research assessment,
      the development of\\nnational matrixes for career assessment, the movement towards
      adopting\\nnarrative CVs, and the importance of transparency and reproducibility
      in\\nopen science.\\n\\n### Next steps\\n\\nTo call something a knowledge platform
      is undoubtedly ambitious. Our\\nfour open science seminars were designed to
      introduce fundamental\\nconcepts and to put these in the context of ongoing
      policy initiatives.\\nWe recognize there is still much more to explore, so we
      built the\\nplatform to be updated and expanded. In this way, new topics can
      be\\nadded to follow the development of open science and enrich the\\nplatform\\\\'s
      content.\\n\\nFor instance, at CWTS, we already plan to delve into topics such
      as the\\nopen science pillars proposed by the [UNESCO Recommendation on Open\\nScience](https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      the convergence of open science and Responsible Research and\\nInnovation (RRI).
      We are also interested, for instance, in learning from\\nthe Global South\\\\'s
      efforts in the diamond open access model over the\\npast two decades.\\n\\nWe
      also welcome contributions from new open science champions, as the\\nplatform
      is open to growth and development. If you would like to be part\\nof this effort,
      please reach out [to\\nme](mailto:a.l.brasil@cwts.leidenuniv.nl){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      Launching\\nthe open science knowledge platform is a first step to something
      bigger,\\nto a dynamic resource that evolves, reflecting the constantly changing\\nnature
      of open science.\\n\\n### **Reflections on a co-creation process**\\n\\nThe
      journey to prepare our seminar series and organize the contents into\\na knowledge
      platform has been quite interesting and rewarding. While we\\nhad the chance
      to debate the state of the art of open science within\\nCWTS, we had to build
      a practical program that could be valuable to\\nthose working with the topic
      at different levels, including funding,\\nevaluation, and policy design. That
      was a mission accomplished by\\nadopting a co-creation perspective with our
      partners at NWO and RCN. So,\\nwe very much like to thank Maria Cruz, Anthony
      Gadsdon, Marte Qvenild,\\nand Christian Lund not only for fruitful discussions
      around the program\\nand the outcomes, but also for an active partnership in
      every seminar.\\n\\nFurthermore, it's also quite important for us to thank our
      champions.\\nEarly in the design of the seminar series, we decided to invite\\nadditional
      experts to contribute with their own ideas, perspectives, and\\nexperiences
      on open science. The nine champions that joined us have\\nexpanded our own understanding
      on open science and helped us create a\\nmuch more comprehensive seminars than
      we would be able to do alone. So,\\nwe also extend our thanks to Sonja Grossberndt,
      Sanli Faez, John Arne\\nR\xF8ttingen, Anne Scheel, Anna van't Veer, Marjan Grootveld,
      Korbinian\\nB\xF6ls, Kim Huijpen, and Alexander Jensenius.\\n\\nAnd with that,

      research has become increasingly complex, multidisciplinary,\\ncollaborative,
      and transnational. The institutions that underpin\\nresearch - including communication
      and evaluation systems - are trying\\nto keep up, with varying levels of success.
      At the same time, our\\nsociety is facing major challenges, including existential
      global health,\\nwelfare, and sustainability issues. Obtaining solid evidence-informed\\nsolutions
      to address these challenges requires a research system that\\nencourages collaboration
      between researchers and with societal\\nstakeholders, that values intellectual
      curiosity, outside-the-box\\nthinking, and a diversity of perspectives, and
      that stimulates open\\nsharing of results. It also requires a research system
      that reflects on\\nits own role in society and its own shortcomings. This is
      the research\\nsystem that we, at CWTS, want to help create.\\n\\nIn the coming
      six years, CWTS will operate under the heading of a new\\nhigh-level strategic
      plan. In this blog post we share the purpose and\\nmission of this new knowledge
      agenda. Our knowledge agenda replaces the\\nresearch program [*Valuing Science
      and\\nScholarship*](https://www.cwts.nl/download/f-x2q2x2.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nthat
      we have been working on between 2017 and 2022.  \\n\\n### Not another research
      program\\n\\nWhilst it is common for research institutes at Dutch universities
      to\\nhave a *research program*, over the past years we began to feel the\\nlimits
      of a framing that prioritizes research and leaves less room for\\nother important
      activities. Instead, we wanted our new strategy to\\nembrace all our activities,
      from our fundamental research to our tool\\ndevelopment, and from our interventions
      in policy and education to our\\nconsultancy and contract work. The term *knowledge
      agenda* is intended\\nto communicate this inclusive ambition. It describes the
      mission we will\\nwork on, the collective values we will uphold, and the strategic
      topics\\nwe will address.  \\n\\n### Mission\\n\\nIn the lead-up to this new
      knowledge agenda, we spent a considerable\\namount of time in 2022 discussing
      with the entire CWTS team the mission\\nand values of our centre. We also organized
      two retreats that included\\nbrainstorming sessions with academic partners and
      other stakeholders and\\neven offered an opportunity to [develop dream\\nprojects](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/dreaming-at-cwts).
      And\\nfinally, we worked on defining focal areas for our institute and\\ndeveloped
      a new organizational structure around these focal areas. We\\nwill introduce
      these focal areas in a [next blog\\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-focal-areas-of-cwts).\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/20230509-knowledge-agenda.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"33918\\\"
      alt=\\\"Knowledge agenda\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\n  \\nTogether, we came up with
      the following mission statement for our\\ncentre:\\n\\n*Our mission at CWTS
      is to improve how science is practiced and governed\\nand how it serves society*\\n\\nTo
      realize this mission, we aim to develop a deep understanding of the\\ndynamics
      of scientific knowledge production, based on in-depth\\nengagement with a broad
      range of scientific and societal stakeholders.\\nWe also aim to contribute to
      reforms in research assessment, adoption of\\nopen science practices, changes
      in research cultures, and innovations in\\nresearch analytics. Moreover, recognizing
      that we are part of the\\nresearch system ourselves, we strive to practice what
      we preach and to\\nlead by example.  \\n\\n### Values\\n\\nIn our new knowledge
      agenda, we are trying to adopt a [more explicitly\\nvalue-led\\nframework](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/responsible-research-culture-practicing-what-we-preach-at-cwts)\\nthat
      aims for congruence between the knowledge we create, our own\\nresearch culture,
      and our internal governance mechanisms. The goal of\\n'practicing what we preach'
      is to foster a positive culture at our\\ncentre, not only stemming from our
      knowledge about the research system,\\nbut also born from and carried by the
      CWTS community. To incorporate a\\nmore active reflection on our own values
      into our strategy, we\\ncollectively developed four core values to guide our
      work and\\ndecision-making:  \\n\\n- *Transformative.* We want to make a difference
      by inciting\\n  transformative changes in the way science is practiced and governed\\n
      \ and the way it serves society.\\n\\n- *Evidence-informed.* We value evidence-informed
      work and\\n  policy-making. We collect scientific evidence and act on it, but
      we\\n  also acknowledge its limitations. Scientific evidence offers essential\\n
      \ insights for improving how science is practiced and governed, but\\n  these
      insights are always tentative and dependent on context.\\n\\n- *Collaborative.*
      We value collaborative work. To address the complex\\n  challenges faced by
      science and society, we prefer to collaborate\\n  rather than compete, both
      internally within our team and with external\\n  stakeholders. We cherish a
      diversity of perspectives and strive for a\\n  balanced representation and recognition
      of everyone's interests and\\n  contributions.\\n\\n- *Responsible.* We promote
      more responsible ways of practicing and\\n  governing science, for instance
      by making research processes more\\n  inclusive, research evaluations more fair,
      and research analytics more\\n  transparent. We practice what we preach by making
      our own way of\\n  working more responsible.\\n\\n### The coming years\\n\\nThe
      CWTS knowledge agenda 2023-2028 is intended to be an encompassing,\\nhigh-level,
      and value-led strategic plan. It is meant to focus our\\nefforts at a time when
      pushes for reform in research assessment and the\\nincreased need for openness
      in research practices provide us with a\\nunique opportunity to contribute to
      a stronger and healthier research\\nsystem. Among other things, we plan to consider
      how research evaluation\\nin its many forms conditions research agendas, notions
      of quality, and\\ndaily practices of research and scholarly communication; how
      strategic\\nand meaningful public engagement can become integral to realizing
      the\\nvalue and relevance of academic research; how policy recommendations for\\nmore
      inclusive and diverse academic careers can be developed; and how\\nstructural
      inequities and lack of diversity and inclusion in global\\nscience can be better
      understood and addressed. Tackling these and other\\nquestions requires joint
      action by many different stakeholders in the\\nresearch system. With our new
      knowledge agenda, we hope to meaningfully\\ncontribute to this in the years
      to come.  \\n\",\"published_at\":1683621900,\"updated_at\":1708703227,\"indexed_at\":1708117323,\"authors\":[{\"name\":

      an agenda gaining attention\\ntoday. The blog post gives an introduction to
      RRA and discusses how to\\nnavigate RRA guidelines, which can be a complex task.\\n\\n###
      What is Responsible Research Assessment (RRA)?\\n\\nA search for definitions
      of RRA resulted in:\\n\\n- [\\\\\\\"Responsible metrics as a way of framing
      appropriate uses of\\n  quantitative indicators in the governance, management
      and assessment\\n  of\\n  research\\\\\\\"](https://www.ukri.org/publications/review-of-metrics-in-research-assessment-and-management/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n-
      [\\\\\\\"Responsible research evaluation focuses on producing research\\n  metrics
      that adhere to certain principles, such as data accuracy,\\n  transparent data
      collection and analysis or making use of a diversity\\n  of\\n  indicators.\\\\\\\"](http://services.igi-global.com/resolvedoi/resolve.aspx?doi=10.4018/978-1-7998-2181-6.ch003){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n-
      RRA [\\\\\\\"is an umbrella term for approaches to assessment which\\n  incentivise,
      reflect and reward the plural characteristics of\\n  high-quality research,
      in support of diverse and inclusive research\\n  cultures.\\\\\\\"](https://rori.figshare.com/articles/report/The_changing_role_of_funders_in_responsible_research_assessment_progress_obstacles_and_the_way_ahead/13227914){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nTwo
      definitions focus on principles for working with metrics, and the\\nthird on
      supporting diverse and inclusive research culture through\\nresearch assessment.
      All are valid, and one unifying definition is still\\nlacking. Also, the terminology
      varies. Assessment and evaluation or\\nmetrics and indicators are used interchangeably.\\n\\nIt
      can be difficult to pinpoint exactly what RRA is and getting an\\noverview of
      RRA is equally complex. One approach, however, is RRA\\nguidelines that explain
      RRA and guide its implementation. Some\\ninternationally well-known RRA guidelines
      are: [San Francisco\\nDeclaration on Research Assessment\\n(DORA)](https://sfdora.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      [Leiden\\nManifesto](https://doi.org/10.1038/520429a){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      [Hong Kong\\nPrinciples](https://www.wcrif.org/guidance/hong-kong-principles){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nand\\n[SCOPE](https://inorms.net/scope-framework-for-research-evaluation/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nA
      common starting point for RRA and its guidelines is that traditional\\nquantitative
      research assessment and its emphasis on bibliometric\\nindicators may be easy
      to apply but has many biases. Criticism of\\ntraditional indicators is seen,
      for example, in DORA leading to the\\nrecommendation not to use Journal Impact
      Factors for research funding,\\nappointment, and promotion considerations.\\n\\nTraditional
      quantitative research assessment is indicator- or\\ndata-driven, meaning that
      popular indicators---for example the Journal\\nImpact Factor---or easily available
      data are the staring points of\\nassessments. Instead, RRA focuses on the entity
      to be assessed and\\nstarts with what seems to be lacking in the traditional
      quantitative\\nresearch assessments, for example, the values (cf. SCOPE), or
      the\\nresearch integrity (cf. Hong Kong Principles) of the entity to be\\nassessed.\\n\\n###
      Who use RRA guidelines?\\n\\nUniversities' adoption of RRA guidelines is relatively
      new, and [many\\nuniversities use DORA or Leiden Manifesto, sometimes to develop
      local\\nRRA\\npolicies](https://thebibliomagician.wordpress.com/2022/08/04/results-from-the-2021-responsible-metrics-state-of-the-art-survey/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nIt
      is possible to endorse DORA and Hong Kong Principles at their\\nwebsites, and
      the long lists of signatories show that not only\\nuniversities but also other
      institutions from the research sector\\nsupport RRA, for example, funders, publishers,
      learned societies,\\ngovernmental agencies, etc. Also, individuals are among
      the signatories.\\n\\nRRA guidelines are not only relevant at the individual,
      local, and\\nnational level. The European Commission has published an agreement
      on\\nhow to reform research assessment. [The RRA guidelines contribute to the\\nbasis
      for the reform, and the guidelines are among the tools for the\\npractical implementation
      of the\\nreform](https://coara.eu/app/uploads/2022/09/2022_07_19_rra_agreement_final.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\n###
      What are the scopes of RRA guidelines?\\n\\nFor institutions or individuals
      new to RRA, it can be difficult to\\nnavigate the guidelines. Which guidelines
      are relevant? What are the\\nscopes of the guidelines? How are the guidelines
      applied? Etc.\\n\\nTo answer these questions, [the Evaluation Checklists Project
      Charter\\nand its Criteria for Evaluation\\nChecklists](https://wmich.edu/sites/default/files/attachments/u350/2019/EvalChecklistsProject-Charter.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nis
      useful. The criteria are developed by experts from evaluation\\nresearch with
      the mission to \\\"advance excellence in evaluation by\\nproviding high-quality
      checklists to guide practice\\\" and the vision \\\"for\\nall evaluators to
      have the information they need to provide exceptional\\nevaluation service and
      advance the public good\\\".\\n\\nUsing the criteria *RRA guideline addresses
      one or more specific\\nevaluation tasks* and *RRA guideline clarifies or simplifies
      complex\\ncontent to guide performance of evaluation tasks*, it becomes apparent\\nthat
      the four guidelines mentioned earlier differ in their scopes: SCOPE\\naims to
      improve the assessment process, Hong Kong Principles wants to\\nstrengthen research
      integrity, Leiden Manifesto stresses accountability\\nin metrics-based research
      assessment, and DORA focuses on assessment of\\nresearch publications but also
      other types of output. (See also [this\\nposter from the Nordic Workshop on
      Bibliometrics and Research\\nPolicy](https://pure.itu.dk/ws/files/87075445/Poster_NW2022_Bruun_Gauffriau.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\n\\n###
      How easy are RRA guidelines to use?\\n\\nAbove it is shown that the first criteria
      can help understand the scope\\nof a RRA guideline. Whether a guideline is easy
      to use may be addressed\\nby the next sections of Criteria for Evaluation Checklists:
      *Clarity of\\nPurpose*, *Completeness and Relevance*, *Organization*, *Clarity
      of\\nWriting*, and *References and Sources*.\\n\\nEspecially, the criteria on
      *Clarity of Purpose* address how to use a\\nchecklist. Not all four RRA guidelines
      discussed here are clear on all\\nof these criteria, i.e., the process of applying
      the guidelines instead\\nof simply the result of using the guidelines. Here
      are some examples of\\nhow to meet these criteria and, thus, help the user applying
      the\\nguideline:\\n\\nSCOPE discusses the criterion *The circumstances in which
      it \\\\[the\\nguideline\\\\] should be used* and concludes that research assessment
      and,\\nthus, the use of SCOPE is not always the right solution. Assessment is\\nnot
      recommended to incentivize specific behaviours. For example, open\\naccess publishing
      would benefit more from making it easy for a\\nresearcher to comply than from
      measuring the researcher's share of open\\naccess publications.\\n\\nDORA addresses
      the criterion *Intended users*. The sections in the\\nguideline mention intended
      users. The users are funding agencies,\\nresearch institutions, publishers,
      organizations that supply metrics,\\nand researchers.\\n\\nLeiden Manifesto
      and Hong Kong Principles, respectively, have relatively\\nclear purposes because
      of their delimited scopes; accountability in\\nmetrics-based research assessment
      and strengthen research integrity.\\n\\nThe criteria sections *Completeness
      and Relevance*, *Organization*,\\n*Clarity of Writing*, and *References and
      Sources* further review how\\nwell a guideline supports the RRA process. For
      example, the four\\nguidelines provide illustrative examples and cases, but
      all aspects of\\nan assessment task are not necessarily covered. And the guidelines
      are\\norganized in sections, but it is not always clear how this organization\\nsupports
      the RRA process.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nRRA does not have a clear definition,
      and RRA guidelines can be\\ndifficult to apply. The Criteria for Evaluation
      Checklists provides a\\ntool developed by evaluation researchers that can help
      users choose\\nrelevant RRA guidelines for their work. Applying the understanding
      of\\nRRA guidelines constituted by the Evaluation Checklists Project Charter\\nmay
      also facilitate a systematic analysis of RRA guidelines that could\\nlead to
      a clearer definition of RRA.\\n\\n### ~Acknowledgements~\\n\\n~This work was

      come back to Taiwan. When I learned that the STI 2022 conference\\nwould be

      it was not certain from the beginning\\nthat I would actually be able to attend
      the conference, but in the end\\nit all worked out. I was privileged to attend
      the STI 2022 conference\\nand extremely grateful for this opportunity. My trip
      was relatively\\nshort, and I did not have much time to enjoy the beautiful
      scenery of\\nGranada. People might wonder if attending the conference for less
      than a\\nweek was worth traveling here from a faraway country. I did remember
      one\\ncolleague asking me this question, and my answer was, \\\"Yes, definitely.\\\"\\n\\n###
      What reconnecting means to me\\n\\nIt is because I reconnected to the center
      of the bibliometric community\\nagain! As a researcher from faraway Asia, I
      sometimes felt lost because\\nmany new topics have not yet been discussed at
      my place. Attending the\\nSTI conference live again gave me an excellent opportunity
      to follow the\\nlatest trends and have face-to-face discussions with my international\\npeers.
      For instance, I noticed more and more studies and discussions\\nabout open infrastructures
      and new databases like Overton. The topic of\\ndiversity has gained more attention,
      with bibliometric analyses\\nsupporting policy-making in this area. Triangulating
      quantitative and\\nqualitative analyses has become more common. Many interesting
      works\\nrelated to funding policy also allowed me to understand the funding\\nmechanisms
      in European countries better. I could even get in touch with\\nparticipants
      who work at funding organizations. Not to mention that it\\nwas great to know
      who else is studying OA publishing and APCs, which is\\none of my research interests.\\n\\nMoreover,
      I made some personal \\\"breakthroughs\\\". For instance, it was my\\nfirst
      time hosting an STI conference session, my first presentation on\\ninternational
      collaboration, and my first time being part of the\\nreviewers. I have learned
      a lot from preparation to presentation, which\\ngave me more confidence.\\n\\nBesides
      that, I also attended the first-ever \\\\\\\"[*Women in Science Policy\\n(WISP)*](https://twitter.com/Women_SciPolicy){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\\"
      event at\\nthe conference. This was organized by Gemma Derrick, Cassidy R. Sugimoto\\nand
      Caroline Wagner,\_who attempted to advocate for acknowledging women\\nin science
      policy to relevant stakeholders and to build up the network\\nfor female researchers
      to coordinate matches between mentors and\\nmentees. All female participants
      from different career stages were\\ninvited to attend this event on the first
      day after the reception\\ncocktail. The senior female researchers were genuinely
      willing to share\\ntheir experiences. When they heard questions from the junior\\nresearchers,
      they even would introduce other senior researchers who had\\nsimilar backgrounds
      or had encountered similar issues before to juniors.\\nFor me, I did get to
      know more female researchers during the WISP event.\\nIt was a more relaxed
      environment than the coffee breaks during the\\ndaytime. The atmosphere, in
      general, was great. It did create a safe and\\nfriendly space without any burden.
      Usually, during coffee breaks, people\\nupdate each other on research progress
      and career status, discuss their\\nthoughts on the last session or plenary meeting,
      or introduce and\\nexchange contact information in a hurry. At the WISP, I felt
      more\\ncomfortable asking questions and seeking advice like career planning.\\n\\nOf
      course, some of these observations and experiences could also have\\nbeen achieved
      via online conferences, but the live and immediate\\ndiscussions with international
      peers is the most valuable thing. It is\\nsomething that is hardly replaced
      by virtual conferences. Real-time and\\nphysical conferences provide opportunities
      for connecting. We can\\ninteract through more frequent social events like coffee
      breaks,\\nlunches, and dinners. It also gives us a more flexible schedule for
      \\\"pre\\nand post-conference activity\\\" to enhance the connection. Grasping
      the\\nopportunity to explore the city on the day before the conference starts\\nor
      extending the happy-hour time after the conference ends is a way to\\nget to
      know our colleagues better.\\n\\n### Hybrid conferences -- a compromise? {#hybrid-conferences-a-compromise}\\n\\nEven
      though online conference formats may hardly replace the real and\\nlive interactions
      during physical conferences, attending international\\nconferences has its economic
      and environmental costs and may not always\\nbe possible or desired. Here is
      where hybrid conferences can be a\\nsolution and might even help to ensure inclusion
      and diversity. During\\nthe pandemic, organizing a conference in the online
      format let academic\\ncommunities get used to the new model of scholarly communication.\\n\\nBut
      how do we make online experiences as likeable as meeting physically?\\nI think
      the most important thing is: people online should not feel left\\nout or disconnected.
      Besides some issues with technical equipment or\\ninternet connection, we often
      see them being forgotten during\\ndiscussions. In that sense, ensuring every
      session host knows how to\\nhost hybrid conferences is essential.\\n\\nRegarding
      social activities, pure online conferences usually rely on\\nchatrooms or even
      games to proceed; however, it seems impossible to\\nengage people online and
      offline in the same social activities at the\\nsame time, for example, having
      a city tour together. This requires\\ncreative thinking to come up with approaches
      that make the conference\\nexperience enjoyable for both offline and online
      participants.  \\n\\n### Looking forward to STI 2023\\n\\nHere I would like
      to express my gratitude again to the organizing\\ncommittee of the STI 2022
      conference! I really appreciate the idea of\\ninviting more early career researchers
      to host sessions and organizing\\nthe WISP event to provide an excellent opportunity
      for female\\nresearchers to get to know each other, engage in conversations,
      and\\nexchange experiences. Now I am looking forward to the next one -- [STI\\n2023
      in Leiden](https://www.sti2023.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}. The\\norganizing
      committee has already [announced that it will be held in a\\nhybrid\\nway](https://twitter.com/Ednoyons/status/1568535459525001217?t=tRE7p6tYDkBGukYhtP8u_A&s=19){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nMoreover,

      we published two years ago together with our colleague Aaron Tay,\\nwe discussed
      numerous ways in which open abstracts can be of great\\nvalue. This includes

      and using more advanced text mining\\nand visualization tools. It also includes
      the analysis of the structure\\nand dynamics of research fields using bibliometric

      and\\n[CiteSpace](http://cluster.cis.drexel.edu/~cchen/citespace/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nIn
      addition, we pointed out that open abstracts can be used to support\\nsystematic
      literature reviewing, to algorithmically identify relations\\nbetween scholarly
      outputs, to assign these outputs to research topics or\\nresearch fields, and
      to enable automatic knowledge extraction, for\\ninstance by algorithmically
      identifying biomedical entities and\\ngene-disease associations.\\n\\nPublishers
      typically make abstracts freely available on their websites.\\nHowever, to support
      the above use cases, it is essential that abstracts\\nare openly available in
      a centralized infrastructure. For publishers\\nthat work with [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      to\\nregister DOIs for their content, the [Initiative for Open Abstracts\\n(I4OA)](https://i4oa.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      recommends making abstracts\\nopenly available through Crossref.  \\n\\n###
      Many other publishers have already opened their abstracts. What is the significance
      of the step taken by Wiley? {#many-other-publishers-have-already-opened-their-abstracts.-what-is-the-significance-of-the-step-taken-by-wiley}\\n\\nIndeed
      many publishers have already opened their abstracts, and of these\\npublishers
      100 are also [formal supporters of\\nI4OA](https://i4oa.org/#publishers){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      This includes\\nHindawi, Royal Society, and SAGE, three of the [founding organizations\\nof
      I4OA](https://i4oa.org/#founders){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}. Abstracts are\\ncurrently
      openly available for 39% of the journal articles in Crossref\\nin the period
      2020-2022. Until today, however, of the world's five\\nlargest publishers, in
      terms of number of journal articles, MDPI was the\\nonly one supporting I4OA.
      Of these five publishers, [Wiley is now the\\nsecond one joining\\nI4OA](https://www.wiley.com/network/researchers/open-research/wiley-expands-commitment-to-open-research){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nIt
      follows the example of Hindawi, which was acquired by Wiley last\\nyear. Given
      that Wiley published 6% of the journal articles in Crossref\\nin the period
      2020-2022, we see Wiley's support for I4OA as an important\\nmilestone for openness
      of abstracts.  \\n\\n### What do you expect other large publishers will do?\\n\\nWith
      support for I4OA from the world's third (Wiley) and fourth (MDPI)\\nlargest
      publisher, we do not see any credible argument for other large\\npublishers,
      in particular Elsevier, Springer Nature, and Taylor &\\nFrancis, to withhold
      their support for open abstracts.\\n\\nSpringer Nature is under pressure from
      the [editors of its flagship\\njournal\\n*Nature*](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-022-02915-1){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nto
      support open abstracts. It is already making abstracts openly\\navailable through
      Crossref for its open access content, but unlike Wiley\\nand other publishers
      supporting I4OA, its policy is not to make\\nabstracts openly available for
      its subscription content. Extending its\\nsupport for open abstracts to all
      its content seems a natural next step\\nfor Springer Nature.\\n\\nWhile it may
      take a bit more time, we expect that Taylor & Francis and\\nElsevier will follow
      as well. Taylor & Francis has a daughter company,\\nF1000, that was one of the
      [initial supporters of\\nI4OA](https://i4oa.org/press.html#pressrelease){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      We do\\nnot see any reason for Taylor & Francis not to follow the example of
      its\\ndaughter company.\\n\\nIn an apparent attempt to protect its Scopus business,
      Elsevier\\ninitially declined to open its citations, despite [strong protest
      from\\nthe scientometric\\ncommunity](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/01/14/elsevier-journal-editors-resign-start-rival-open-access-journal){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nHowever,
      in 2020, Elsevier changed its position and [joined the\\nInitiative for Open
      Citations\\n(I4OC)](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/q-a-about-elseviers-decision-to-open-its-citation){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nOf
      the larger publishers, Elsevier was one of the last ones to open its\\ncitations.
      To prevent this history from repeating itself, we are hopeful\\nthat Elsevier
      will act more swiftly in opening its abstracts.  \\n\\n### How does the step
      taken by Wiley fit into the bigger picture of openness of metadata of scholarly
      outputs?\\n\\nWhile openness of abstracts and citations is of critical importance,
      it\\nis of limited value if other metadata is not made openly available as\\nwell.
      This for instance includes affiliation and funding metadata,\\nlicense information,
      and links between scholarly outputs, such as links\\nbetween preprints and the
      corresponding journal articles or between\\njournal articles and the associated
      data sets. This metadata should as\\nmuch as possible make use of openly-governed
      persistent identifiers, for\\ninstance [ORCID](https://orcid.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      and\\n[ROR](https://ror.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} identifiers.\\n\\nAs can
      be seen in the figure below, in recent years publishers have made\\nsignificant
      progress in making metadata of journal articles openly\\navailable through Crossref.
      More detailed statistics reported in [this\\npreprint](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/smxe5){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      show\\nthat Wiley is doing a good job by making affiliation metadata openly\\navailable.
      Other large publishers, such as Elsevier, Springer Nature,\\nand MDPI, have
      not yet taken this step. Like many publishers, Wiley is\\nalso making funding
      metadata openly available. However, as shown in\\nrecent analyses (see\\n[here](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00212){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      and\\n[here](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00210){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}), for
      many\\npublishers the funding metadata made available through Crossref suffers\\nfrom
      gaps and other quality issues.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/QA-about-Wiley\u2019s-decision-to-open-its-abstracts_image1.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"29565\\\"\\nalt=\\\"rcentage

      \ \\n]{.caption dir=\\\"ltr\\\"}\\n\\nIn some cases, metadata that is not made
      available through Crossref can\\nbe obtained from other open data sources, such
      as\\n[OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}. OpenAlex collects\\naffiliation
      metadata from publisher websites and makes this metadata\\nopenly available.
      As shown in a [recent\\nanalysis](https://github.com/Curtin-Open-Knowledge-Initiative/open-metadata-report/blob/main/reports/run_20221008_1/report_template_singleDB.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nperformed
      by one of us, OpenAlex is able to provide affiliation metadata\\nfor publishers
      that do not deposit this metadata to Crossref. However,\\nthis metadata has
      not been 'authorized' by publishers and may suffer\\nfrom inaccuracies due to
      technical challenges in the algorithmic\\nextraction of metadata from publisher
      websites.\\n\\nSimilarly, OpenAlex is able to provide abstracts for 75-80% of
      the\\nrecent journal articles in Crossref, partly by scraping abstracts from\\npublisher
      websites, which might cause accuracy issues. These abstracts\\nare made available
      in an 'inverted format' (i.e., as a list of\\nindividual words with location
      indicators) for copyright reasons, which\\nis somewhat cumbersome and potentially
      less sustainable than having\\nabstracts made available by publishers in their
      Crossref metadata.\\n\\n### How can researchers and other actors in the research
      community contribute to openness of abstracts and other metadata?\\n\\nRealizing
      openness of abstracts and other metadata requires significant\\nefforts by publishers
      and their technology providers, and also by the\\nteam of Crossref. Other actors
      in the research community can contribute\\nas well, in particular by showing
      the value they attach to open\\nmetadata.\\n\\nResearchers can contribute by
      taking openness of metadata, including\\nabstracts, into account when choosing
      the journal to which they submit\\ntheir work. Openness of metadata will reduce
      the dependency on\\nproprietary platforms such as Scopus and Web of Science
      for discovery of\\nresearch and assessment of researchers. Crossref provides
      [Participation\\nReports](https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      that\\nresearchers can use to get a quick overview of the metadata that a\\npublisher
      makes openly available through Crossref.\\n\\nResearch funders can make a contribution
      by including openness of\\nmetadata as a requirement in their open access policies.
      This is for\\ninstance already done in [Plan\\nS](https://www.coalition-s.org/technical-guidance_and_requirements/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nLikewise,
      research institutions and their libraries can contribute by\\nincluding openness
      of metadata in their negotiations with publishers, as\\nsuggested by the [TIB\\nlibrary](https://blogs.tib.eu/wp/tib/2020/09/24/tib-supports-initiative-for-open-abstracts-i4oa/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\none
      of the more than 60 [stakeholders supporting\\nI4OA](https://i4oa.org/#stakeholders){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nIf
      you would like to contribute to openness of abstracts, the I4OA team\\nis happy
      to help. Feel free to reach out, either on\\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/open_abstracts){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}

      of its use, as well as an increasing number of\\n[educational\\nprojects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:School_and_university_projects)\\nthat
      integrate it into the classroom. This conflict has yet to be\\nresolved, although
      the general perception has progressively improved\\nover time.\\n\\nIn the case
      of scientometrics, its community has been studying the\\npresence of science
      on Wikipedia since before the formal [birth of\\n'altmetrics](http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/)'.
      In most cases, however,\\nthese previous studies have mostly focused on the
      analysis of the\\nscientific works mentioned on Wikipedia, rather than taking
      Wikipedia\\nitself as their main research object. This science-centric focus\\ntypically
      overlooks the potential of exploring the different\\nrelationships that Wikipedia
      has (or doesn't have) with science. In this\\npost I reflect about such potential
      by presenting five key facts about\\nthe nature of Wikipedia and its possibilities
      as a research source for\\nthe study of science-society interactions.\\n\\n###
      **1) Why are scientific publications cited on Wikipedia?** {#why-are-scientific-publications-cited-on-wikipedia}\\n\\nThe
      most common critique of Wikipedia has to do with the reliability of\\nits contents,
      a problem that Wikipedia itself [exhibits with complete\\ntransparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nIn
      its quest for reliability, Wikipedia places great importance on\\n[verifiability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nwhich
      is one of its [core content\\npolicies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Core_content_policies){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nThere
      are several issues in these content policy guidelines that cannot\\nbe overlooked
      when studying Wikipedia citations to scientific\\npublications. Firstly, Wikipedia
      is an encyclopaedia. It may seem\\nobvious, but as stated in its content policy
      guidelines, \\\\\\\"*Wikipedia\\ndoes not publish* [*original\\nresearch*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\\\\\\".\\nMoreover,
      Wikipedia only publishes information of [encyclopaedic\\nrelevance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Encyclopedic_content){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nSecondly,
      not all sources are valid as citations on Wikipedia. At the\\ntop of the [list
      of source\\ntypologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nrecommended
      by Wikipedia are peer-reviewed scientific publications.\\n[Books are one of
      the most relevant\\nmaterials](https://doi.org/10.1108/AJIM-06-2018-0152){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThis
      relevance of books for Wikipedia has even led publishers to offer\\nfree access
      to their collections to Wikipedia editors via proposals such\\nas [The Wikipedia\\nLibrary](https://wikipedialibrary.wmflabs.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nThe
      fundamental difference between Wikipedia citations and scientific\\ncitations
      cannot be ignored, as the interpretation of these differs\\ngreatly. Thus, the
      dynamic nature of Wikipedia must be clearly\\nunderstood. Contrary to the static
      nature of citations to scientific\\npapers, which theoretically speaking can
      never decrease, [the references\\nin a Wikipedia article can indeed\\ndisappear](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00171){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      and\\neven reappear later. Analysing this phenomenon through a snapshot in\\nwhich
      only the resources cited at a specific moment in time appear is\\nuseful, but
      it may hinder the consideration of all these fluctuations\\nand specificities
      of Wikipedia citations.\\n\\n### **2) Linguistic and cultural multiverses**
      {#linguistic-and-cultural-multiverses}\\n\\nWikipedia is a decentralised medium
      whose management falls in the hands\\nof its [community of\\neditors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_community){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nalso
      known as *wikipedians*, who dictate (many of) its\\n[policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nwhich
      must therefore have the [support of the\\ncommunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThere
      is nothing immutable on Wikipedia. This is an important feature,\\nresulting
      in [more than 300 language\\neditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nwhich
      are far from being mere translations. The community of\\n*wikipedians* for each
      edition (also known as\\n[*wikipedistas*](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedistas){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      Spanish,\\n[*wikip\xE9diens*](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikip%C3%A9dia:Wikip%C3%A9diens){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      French or\\n[*wikipedianen*](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedianen){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      Dutch) establishes their own policies and manages their contents. It\\nis enough
      to take a quick look at the main page of the\\n[Spanish](https://es.wikipedia.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\n[French](https://fr.wikipedia.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      and\\n[Dutch](https://nl.wikipedia.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} Wikipedias to\\nobserve
      clear differences. In fact, even the design or the name itself\\ncan have a
      slight variation, see for example the case of the [Catalan\\nViquip\xE8dia](https://ca.wikipedia.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      or the\\n[Galician](https://gl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galipedia)\\n[*Galipedia*](https://gl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galipedia){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThis
      obviously has an impact on the contents, which may introduce\\n[cultural](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2018.00054){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n[biases](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2018.00054).\\n\\nAlthough
      the edits made to Wikipedia articles can come from users who\\ncontribute independently,
      there are also communities organised around\\ntopics. These are the so-called\\n[WikiProjects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nEach
      of them is focused on a specific topic, for example\\n[astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Astronomy){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\n[cats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Cats)
      or\\n[Lady\\nGaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Lady_Gaga){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nJust
      as each language edition has complete autonomy, so do the\\nWikiProjects. Each
      one establishes its own specific guidelines for the\\ndevelopment and improvement
      of the project\\\\'s articles of interest. They\\ncan provide recommendations,
      such as following a specific structure, or\\neven offer suggested literature,
      as in the case of the [lepidoptera\\nWikiProject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Lepidoptera){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nSome
      of these activities can thus affect the contents of an entire block\\nof articles.
      In addition, especially in the case of the English\\nWikipedia edition, WikiProjects
      organise the articles in a very\\nremarkable way. [Wikipedia articles are\\nclassified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Content_assessment){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\naccording
      to two criteria: the *quality* of the article and its\\n*importance* or priority
      for the WikiProject in question. The use of\\nreferences plays a key role in
      establishing one categorisation or\\nanother. It should be noted that this assignment
      is made freely by\\n*wikipedians*, although the more advanced categories\\n([Featured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_criteria){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand

      Wikipedia articles {#life-beyond-wikipedia-articles}\\n\\nIn Wikipedia, the
      contents of articles are the result of\\n[consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThis
      is not always possible and results in a high number of edits in\\nwhich several
      editors try to get ahead of each other in their respective\\npoints of view.
      Wikipedia refers to these conflicts as [*edit\\nwars*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nand
      some of [the most regrettable\\nones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lamest_edit_wars){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nhave
      been documented. These conflicts are frequent in articles\\nconcerning more
      sensitive and topical issues. When one of these wars\\ntakes place, the community
      tries to reach a consensus on its own or with\\nthe intervention of a\\n[committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nformed
      to help resolve it.\\n\\nFurthermore, *wikipedians* have the possibility to
      discuss the contents\\nof articles openly with the rest of the community. Something
      that often\\ngoes unnoticed on Wikipedia is the [talk\\npage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Talk_pages){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n(you
      can find the link to it next to the article title), where editors\\ndo not only
      leave messages related to changes made or proposed changes,\\nbut also allow
      these contents to be discussed for improvement. The\\nscientific literature
      also has a place in these discussions, for example\\nby [commenting on publications

      Wikipedia classified by topics? {#how-are-the-contents-of-wikipedia-classified-by-topics}\\n\\nThe
      way in which content is classified by topics on Wikipedia has its\\nups and
      downs. Wikipedia\\\\'s main system is the\\n[categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Categories){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n([not
      to be confused with Wikidata\\nConcepts](https://elib.dlr.de/188534/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}),
      a\\n[folksonomy](https://doi.org/10.3145/epi.2017.sep.20){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nwhich,
      in the English edition Wikipedia alone, includes [2 million\\ncategories](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6967464){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      As\\nan example of the usefulness and representativeness of these, the\\nWikipedia
      article\\n[Bibliometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliometrics){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nhas
      only one category\\n([Bibliometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Bibliometrics){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}),\\nwhile
      [Derek J. de Solla\\nPrice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_J._de_Solla_Price){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\\\'s\\narticle
      has 16, with some such as '[1922\\nbirths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:1922_births){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}'\\nand
      '[1983\\ndeaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:1983_deaths){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}'.\\nThis
      problem is undermined by the hierarchical relationships established\\nbetween
      them. Because a category may have more than one parent category,\\nit is difficult
      to establish a single broad topic for each Wikipedia\\narticle.\\n\\nIn addition,
      Wikipedia has other systems that also organise its\\n[contents by\\ntopic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      make browsing easier. Some of these are [overview\\narticles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Overviews){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\n[lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Lists){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nor\\n[portals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Portals){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nSystems
      such as WikiProjects can also be used for this purpose, as they\\ndelimit articles
      related to a topic. There is also no shortage of\\nmachine learning applications,
      such as\\n[ORES](https://ores.wikimedia.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}, an article

      **5) Wikipedia as the ultimate social media for measuring social attention**
      {#wikipedia-as-the-ultimate-social-media-for-measuring-social-attention}\\n\\nFinally,
      there is a wide range of metrics that can be obtained from\\nWikipedia to understand
      the different interactions taking place at\\nWikipedia. In this regard, it is
      worth recalling that Wikipedia is one\\nof the websites with the [highest traffic\\nworldwide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_visited_websites){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nIt
      is in fact easy to find Wikipedia articles at the top of web search\\nengine
      results, attracting millions of visits. Furthermore, not only is\\nthere an
      English Wikipedia, which is the largest one and can be used as\\na proxy for
      international forms of attention, but there are also\\ndifferent language editions
      that can be used to capture local attention.\\nAll things considered, what we
      have is a perfect social thermometer, the\\nusefulness of which has already
      been noted, for example, for [monitoring\\noutbreaks](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003892){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nThe
      number of times an article has been edited, as well as the unique\\nnumber of
      editors involved, can shed light on which articles are most\\nactive and interesting
      for the Wikipedia community to engage with. In\\nthe case of discussions, these
      can even be seen as a proxy for\\nidentifying controversial content. On the
      other hand, the years since\\nthe creation of the article and its length make
      it possible to\\ncharacterise the article, while the number of references to
      scientific\\narticles reflects the scientific orientation or interest of the
      article.\\nThe possibilities are numerous, go far beyond these more general\\napproaches,
      and many have yet to be explored.\\n\\nWhat is certain is that only by paying
      attention to these aspects when\\nanalysing science in this social medium will
      it be possible to\\nunderstand the role that science plays in Wikipedia, beyond
      its greater\\nor lesser presence, as well as the implications and reach of these\\nresources
      within the community of editors and society in general.\\n\",\"published_at\":1673343000,\"updated_at\":1708703227,\"indexed_at\":1708118022,\"authors\":[{\"name\":

      principles outlined\\nin the report into local assessment reforms.\\n\\nThe
      initiative builds on ten years or more of campaigns movements to\\ncurb the
      misappropriation of research metrics in academic research\\nassessment contexts,
      to broaden quality criteria and to change research\\nculture more broadly. The
      fact that such an influential actor as the\\nEuropean Commission has taken up
      the research assessment reform baton\\nsuggests this agenda truly has landed,
      at least in certain policy spaces\\n(see also recent reform efforts being coordinated
      within the\\nNetherlands, Finland, and Norway) (P\xF6l\xF6nen and Mustajoki\\n2022).^[\\\\[1\\\\]](#_ftn1){#footnote-1-ref}^\\n\\nFollowing
      the decision to press ahead with the Agreement, I would like\\nto reflect on
      the strategy the European Commission appears to be\\nadopting for facilitating
      such reforms, and consider some of the\\nopportunities and challenges their
      approach may encounter. Before doing\\nso, I briefly outline what principles
      the European Commission considers\\nto be central to more responsible and fair
      modes of research assessment.\\n\\nThe European Commission's scoping report
      laments the current state of\\nresearch assessment in Europe, which it states
      is driven by races for\\npublications and citations, at the expense of quality,
      and which leads\\nto a publish or perish culture that is damaging for research
      and\\nresearchers. The optimum method for research assessment is said to be\\nqualitative
      peer review, and while the report adopts a critical tone\\ntowards uses of research
      metrics in research assessment - it does not\\ncompletely reject their use as
      long as they are used appropriately in\\nsupporting (not replacing) qualitative
      decision making (citing, for\\nexample, the [Leiden\\nManifesto](http://www.leidenmanifesto.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).
      By\\nsigning the Agreement, research actors are effectively committing to\\nensure
      that their research assessments will:\\n\\n- recognize and reward the plurality
      of contributions researchers make\\n  to academic life (not just publishing
      and bringing in grant money)\\n- respect epistemic differences between research
      fields\\n- reward new (or newly emphasized) quality dimensions such as open\\n
      \ science (broadly defined), research integrity, and societal relevance,\\n
      \ when evaluating individuals, institutions and research proposals.\\n\\nAs
      with the majority of efforts to initiate reforms of research\\nassessment over
      the past decade, the European Commission Agreement is an\\nexample of 'soft
      governance', with the emphasis on steering from a\\ndistance rather than hierarchical
      imposition. The scoping report avoids\\ngiving precise prescriptions on how
      to implement reforms -- rather it\\nprovides a broad vision and signposting
      to researchers and research\\norganizations on how and why they should seek
      to redefine research\\nquality, arguing that adhering to such values is commensurate
      with\\nbetter (or more responsible) 'academic citizenship'. To reiterate,\\nsigning
      the Agreement will be voluntary and *not* a legally binding\\ncommitment: while
      there may be reputational fallout if a signatory were\\nto be seen as not acting
      within the spirit of the Agreement, there are\\nunlikely to be formal sanctions.\\n\\n###
      How far can 'soft governance' take research assessment reform efforts?  {#how-far-can-soft-governance-take-research-assessment-reform-efforts}\\n\\nA
      'soft governance' approach like the Agreement has its attractions for\\ndifferent
      actors across the\_European research landscape: in a period of\\nrestricted
      economic growth and belt tightening around public funding,\\nthe Agreement requires
      little fresh money from the Commission, with\\nindividual signatories expected
      to self-fund their internal changes. The\\nfact an actor like the Commission
      has so visibly put their weight behind\\nthis agenda will no doubt help local
      change agents when lobbying for\\ntheir own research organizations to revisit
      current assessment\\npractices. Likewise the lack of top-down prescriptiveness
      about what\\nexactly the reforms should look like affords agency and flexibility
      to\\nthose on-the-ground in universities, funding bodies or assessment\\nagencies
      to enact changes in a 'bottom up' way. On the flipside, one can\\nenvision potential
      limitations to this soft governance approach: lack of\\nnew, centralized funding
      means universities and other research actors\\nmay not wish (or be able) to
      invest their own scarce resources in\\nenacting this agenda. Furthermore, the
      voluntary 'opt in' nature of the\\nchanges may well mean they can be easily
      ignored by those for whom the\\nshared visions for change do not resonate. Soft
      governance mechanisms\\nlike voluntary agreements ultimately rely on their intended
      audience\\ngetting excited about the vision being set out or feeling a social\\npressure
      to conform, but if big players are seen as ignoring these\\ncalls, or organizations
      see them as too difficult to achieve, then the\\nreforms will likely only be
      taken up sporadically by a handful of\\nenthusiasts.\\n\\nAnother concern mentioned
      in the scoping report is the risk that\\nresearch system actors in some member
      states will adopt reforms much\\nquicker or enthusiastically than others, thus
      threatening potentially\\nthe logic of a common European Research Area (ERA),
      which envisions a\\nsingle borderless market for research and for researchers.
      At national\\nand local levels, influential actors with potential wrecking power
      may\\npresent opposition to the reforms. We have already seen criticisms being\\nvoiced
      against the Agreement from national research actors, for example\\nin Germany,
      where [an alliance of research organizations responded to\\nthe plans for the
      Agreement by stating they are against plans for a\\n'harmonized' European-wide
      assessment system and declaring they will not\\nbe signing\\nup](https://sciencebusiness.net/news/research-assessment-german-funder-raises-concerns-eu-reform-talks-come-close){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nOpposition
      and counter-reform movements are challenges for which\\nchampions of European
      research assessment reform should prepare\\nthemselves.\\n\\nAs such, there
      could well be a bumpy road ahead towards reformed\\nresearch assessment practices
      becoming mainstream across the European\\nUnion. In Leiden, the need to make
      sense of assessment reform\\ndevelopments in Europe and beyond has prompted
      us to establish a\\n[Responsible Evaluation thematic\\nhub](https://www.cwts.nl/research/thematic-hubs/responsible-evaluation){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      our institute, CWTS. Through the Responsible Evaluation Hub, CWTS\\ncolleagues
      will meet bi-monthly to discuss ongoing developments around\\nresearch assessment
      reforms, including projects we are involved in,\\nexternal initiatives, and
      to act as a sounding board for colleagues' own\\nencounters with 'responsibility'
      dilemmas. We think there will be plenty\\nto discuss.\\n\\n[[\\\\[1\\\\]](#footnote-1-ref){#_ftn1}

      review by STIS is extensive and rich and covers\\ninternationalization, mobility,

      to find\\nliterature immediately relevant for international strategic partnerships\\nbetween

      unpacked the notion of international strategic\\npartnerships, to understand

      including the history of the\\npartnership, its goals and implementation plan.\\n\\nSome
      examples to illustrate the diversity the framework needed to cover.\\nAccording
      to the definition developed by our partners, strategic\\npartnerships include
      both research and education. However, it soon\\nbecame clear that some of their
      strategic partnerships are research\\nonly. In addition, according to their
      definition, strategic partnerships\\nare between universities, while we also
      heard about partnerships with a\\nvariety of partners, including local authorities.
      Also, a strategic\\npartnership should be university wide. Yet several of the
      partnerships\\nare focused on one or two topics only. And regarding use and
      governance:\\nwe noticed that some universities wanted to use evaluation to
      gain\\ninsight into the partnership and develop recommendations for\\nimprovement,
      whereas in other universities the evaluation was going to\\nbe used to inform
      decisions.\\n\\nWe heard a lot about the strategic importance of partnerships,
      little\\nabout its implementation and management, and even less about their\\nevaluation.
      We realized that whatever framework we would develop, it\\nwould differ substantively
      from the expectations of a comprehensive\\nevaluation tool. Instead, we felt
      we needed to address simple\\nimplementation and evaluation questions, and we
      wanted to ensure the\\nframework could be used in different governance systems,
      and at any time\\nin a partnership (before, during, towards the end). We therefore
      started\\nto think of a framework consisting of a set of questions and were\\ninspired
      by examples such as the [Societal Readiness Thinking\\nTool](https://thinkingtool.eu/#:~:text=The%20thinking%20tool%20offers%20practical,with%20societal%20needs%20and%20expectations.){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      the [Toolbox Policy\\nEvaluation](https://www.toolboxbeleidsevaluaties.nl/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n(in
      Dutch).\\n\\nWe realized that in order to develop a useful evaluation framework,
      we\\nhad to collaborate closely with the international officers from the six\\npartner
      universities and take them along in the development. We proposed\\nto develop
      the framework on the go. One of us had done so before, when\\ndeveloping a societal
      impact approach with and for research\\ninfrastructures in the\\n[ACCELERATE](https://www.accelerate2020.eu/wp-content/uploads/D-1.5-Final-Assessment-Protocol.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nproject.
      We asked each of the six partners to do a case study, i.e., to\\nevaluate an
      existing strategic partnership and we offered to guide them\\nthrough this approach.
      We also suggested to use a \\\"logbook\\\" and keep\\nnotes of any changes in
      the evaluation, new insights, eye-openers,\\nquestions, etc.\\n\\nAs a result,
      our partners contributed evaluations of, in random order,\\ntheir very first
      partnership; a research collaboration focused on two\\ntopics and two universities;
      a research collaboration of one university\\nwith a variety of partners in a
      specific region; the portfolio of\\npartners in one continent and university
      wide collaborations covering\\nresearch, education as well as professional staff.\\n\\nWe
      organized four online meetings with each partner and planned to\\naddress different
      topics in every meeting. The topic of the first\\nmeeting was the history, rationale
      and context of the partnership and\\nthe reason to evaluate. The result would
      be a clear evaluation question.\\nThe second meeting was dedicated to data collection,
      the third to\\nanalysis of the data and the fourth and final to the interpretation
      of\\nthe evidence collected, and the formulation of the assessment of the\\npartnership.\\n\\nIn
      practice the flow was iterative, and new topics arose every time.\\nComposing
      the evaluation question was not easy at all and required many\\nreformulations.
      The history and rationale of a partnership were\\naddressed in subsequent meetings.
      The implementation of the partnership\\nand the roles and responsibilities were
      brought up more than once. And\\nwhen several partners wanted to reach out to
      researchers and students,\\nwe spent ample time talking about qualitative research
      methods such as\\ninterviews and surveys.\\n\\n<figure style=\\\"float:left;
      margin-right:15px;\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/20221122_Picture2_2022-11-23-154707_revp.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"30189\\\"
      />\\n</figure>\\n\\nAccording to their own account, our partners lost confidence
      when they\\nfirst started working on their case. They grappled with the complexity\\nof
      contextual factors and the variety of perspectives of students,\\nresearchers,
      administrators, and the partner university. However, after\\nfour online meetings,
      they regained confidence when we met in person for\\nthe very first time. They
      presented and discussed their evaluations,\\nthought along with each other,
      and advised on next steps. Several\\nmentioned that it was all about asking
      the right questions and they\\nasked each other the right questions indeed.\\n\\nIn
      the end, the framework we developed together is basically a series of\\nquestions.
      About the context of the evaluation (Why evaluate? What is\\nthe goal?); about
      the specific evaluation (What is the evaluation about?\\nWhat is the central
      question?); and about the context of the partnership\\n(What is the history?
      What are the targets?). Plus, it includes an\\nextensive methodological section.
      When we presented the framework, our\\npartners recognised the questions and
      accepted it as a useful framework.\\n\\n<figure style=\\\"float:right; margin-left:15px;\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/20221122_Picture3_2022-11-23-155045_hwwc.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"30191\\\"
      />\\n</figure>\\n\\nThe final phase of the project was the development of the
      handbook. We\\ndescribed the framework, completed the literature review and
      our\\npartners described their evaluation. Perhaps the most interesting\\nchapter
      is Lessons Learnt from the EVALUATE project, written by our\\npartners. Remember
      how they struggled with the diverse perspectives?\\nThey now acknowledge the
      variety of perspectives, suggest taking these\\ninto account and use participative
      methods. They provide recommendations\\non such diverse topics as data collection,
      the use of evaluation and the\\nimplementation of strategic partnerships. They
      question unrealistic\\nexpectations and bold claims, such as turning students
      into \\\"global\\ncitizens\\\" or using research to address \\\"global challenges\\\".
      And they\\nadvise thinking about evaluation as an opportunity to build capacity
      and\\ninvolve and inspire partners.\\n\\nWe had hoped that talking about evaluation
      of strategic partnerships\\nwould lead to changes in the management and implementation.
      And indeed,\\nwhen we met for the second time, we noticed how our partners were\\nchanging
      their practice. Several had discussed expectations and\\nintentions with their
      partner universities, as well as within their own\\nuniversity. Something they
      hardly did before. Moreover, they wanted to\\nreach out to partner universities
      outside of Europe and Australia and\\nuse the experience, and the framework,
      for these partnerships as well.\\n\\nBut we need to be realistic. In general,
      many see strategic partnerships\\nas, well, of strategic importance. They expect
      great contributions,\\nhowever small the partnership. And when it comes to the
      newest\\ndevelopment of university alliances, expectations are even grander.

      role of (guest) editors amidst increased use of\\neditorial management systems,
      and mechanisms and labels to assure\\nquality in book publishing.\\n\\nWe were
      aware of previous criticism of Frontiers' approach to scholarly\\npublishing
      (see for instance\\n[here](https://forbetterscience.com/2015/10/28/is-frontiers-a-potential-predatory-publisher/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nor\\n[here](https://twitter.com/MaraMather/status/1581300436836921344){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nfor
      a recent example) and intensively discussed whether we should embark\\non this
      project. We came to the conclusion that the topic is important\\nand timely,
      especially in the context of a journal that itself\\nrepresents (and pushes)
      new peer review and editorial practices. That\\nsaid, working with Frontiers
      forced us to develop a form of reflexivity\\nabout our own publishing process
      we would have rather liked to do\\nwithout. More specifically, we aimed to publish
      our reflections on the\\neditorial practices we encountered during our editorship
      as part of the\\nintroduction to the Research Topic, but Frontiers did not allow
      us to.\\nAfter more than half a year of discussions - and particularly long\\nperiods
      of silence from Frontiers - we decided to publish our editorial\\nas a [preprint](https://osf.io/ksg6q){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      and write this\\nblog post to inform the scientific community about our experiences.\\n\\n###
      Concerns about the editorial process\\n\\nOur worries began with the organisation
      of the peer review process\\nitself. Frontiers forces users into a relatively
      rigid workflow that\\nforesees contacting a large number of potential reviewers
      for\\nsubmissions. Reviewers are selected by an internal artificial\\nintelligence
      algorithm on the basis of keywords automatically attributed\\nby the algorithm
      based on the content of the submitted manuscript and\\nmatched with a database
      of potential reviewers, a technique somewhat\\nsimilar to the one used for reviewer
      databases of other big publishers.\\nWhile the importance of the keywords for
      the match can be manually\\nadjusted, the fit between submissions and the actually
      required domain\\nexpertise to review them is often less than perfect. This
      would not be a\\nproblem were the process of contacting reviewers fully under
      the control\\nof the editors. Yet the numerous potential reviewers are contacted
      by\\nmeans of a preformulated email in a quasi-automated fashion, apparently\\nunder
      the assumption that many of them will reject anyway. We find this\\nto be problematic
      because it ultimately erodes the willingness of\\nacademics to donate their
      time for unpaid but absolutely vital community\\nservice. In addition, in some
      cases it resulted in reviewers being\\nassigned to papers in our Research Topic
      that we believed were not\\nqualified to perform reviews. Significant amounts
      of emailing and\\nback-and-forth with managing editors and Frontiers staff were
      required\\nto bypass this system, retract review invitations and instead focus
      only\\non the reviewers we actually wanted to contact. As it turns out, the\\neditorial
      management system is so rigidly set up, that even Frontiers'\\nown staff does
      not always have the ability to adjust key settings.\\n\\nAnother concern we
      had is the pacing of the review and publication\\nprocess. Frontiers aims to
      avoid unnecessary delays in the reviewing of\\nsubmissions, a goal we wholeheartedly
      subscribe to. Yet the intended\\nworkflow is such that reviewers have only seven
      days to complete their\\nreports as a default, with the possibility to extend
      the deadline to\\ntwenty-one days - however, again at the cost of a cumbersome
      process of\\nemailing with Frontiers staff. Also, automatically generated review\\ninvitations
      as described above are sent out if the editors do not send\\nout sufficiently
      many review invitations themselves within three days,\\nincluding weekends,
      holidays and (as was the case with us) summer\\nbreaks. While we see how short
      deadlines can contribute to fast\\ndissemination, we feel that the current standards
      might jeopardize the\\nquality of the review process.\\n\\nA third element of
      the rigidly organised review process we found to be a\\nmixed blessing concerns
      the level of editorial control that editors\\nmaintain.\_In fact, editors are
      encouraged to\_accept manuscripts as soon\\nas they receive two recommendations\_for
      publication by reviewers\\n(regardless of how many other reviewers recommend
      rejection). This holds\\nfor all review rounds. Especially in combination with
      the factors\\nmentioned above, i.e. potentially unqualified reviewers being
      invited\\nand high requirements on review speed, this potentially creates\\nadditional
      challenges to the quality of the editorial process.\\n\\n### Hindered to voice
      reflections\\n\\nAs referred to before, a learning experience of a questionable
      sort was\\nour attempt to publish an editorial that reflected on these issues.
      We\\nnaturally intended to include our editorial in the very special issue we\\nedited.
      However, upon submission of our draft we received a message\\ninforming us that
      our text was not in accordance with the guidelines of\\nFrontiers. They insisted
      that the text could not be published unless we\\ntook out the two paragraphs
      of rather critical reflections on Frontiers'\\neditorial process. We insisted
      that these reflections were an essential\\nelement of our editorial and closely
      related to the content of our\\nResearch Topic, which dealt with the impact
      of editorial processes on\\nknowledge production and dissemination. In addition,
      we felt that being\\nforced to erase the reflections drastically impacted on
      our editorial\\nfreedom. This then led to several emails back and forth, among
      others\\nincluding Frontiers' head of research integrity and various in-house\\neditorial
      staff members. When the issue could not be resolved through\\ncorrespondence,
      we ultimately scheduled a zoom call with Frontiers'\\nChief Executive Editor
      (CEE). We once again explained our stance\\nregarding the appropriateness of
      reflecting on our editorial process in\\nour editorial.\\n\\nIn our meeting,
      the CEE confirmed that such a reflective element was\\nappropriate and that
      Frontiers was of course 'very willing to listen to\\nour feedback'. However,
      he felt that an editorial was not the right\\nplace to voice such reflections.
      There were concerns about \\\"our\\neditorial lacking context\\\". Apparently,
      the issues we identified were\\nspecific to our own process and were in no way
      indicative of Frontiers'\\ngeneral practices. We have reasons to doubt the veracity
      of this claim.\\n\\nSubsequently, we were promised that the CEE would come up
      with a\\nsuggested solution to the situation in the week following our call.\\nAfter
      four months and six reminders, we have still not heard back from\\nFrontiers.
      That is why we decided to publish our editorial as a preprint\\n(in line with
      Frontiers' own preprint policies) and publish this blog\\npost to inform the
      scientific community about our process. We informed\\nthe Frontiers staff about
      the publication of the preprint and this blog\\npost in advance, but once again
      without response from their side.\\n\\n### Towards open scholarly debate\\n\\nBy
      writing this blog, we aim to share our experiences as guest editors\\nat Frontiers,
      contributing to the ongoing debate about changing\\npublishing and editorial
      models. We are generally in favour of improving\\nand innovating editorial and
      peer review processes and find several\\nelements of Frontiers' editorial model
      interesting, including the Open\\nIdentities and Open Reports formats of review,
      and creating a forum for\\nauthors, reviewers and editors to interact. However,
      we have concerns\\nabout other elements, believing that they affect the quality
      and\\nintegrity of the process and published record. We believe that openness\\nabout
      our experiences is important to support stakeholders in making\\ninformed decisions
      about how, where and with whom to engage in the\\npublishing process. We much
      regret Frontiers' attempts to hinder an open\\ndiscussion about these aspects.
      Despite our reflections not being part\\nof the Research Topic, where we still
      feel they would have fitted best,\\nwe hope our editorial/preprint and this
      blog post can trigger the open\\nscholarly debate we believe to be essential.

      I' for invention\\n\\nAcademic researchers and inventors are explorers --\_boldly
      going where\\nno one has gone before. Most people agree on this. However, the\\nrelevance
      of their discoveries or breakthroughs is perceived very\\ndifferently by different
      groups, at least when it comes down to\\ntechnology transfer of that invention
      from universities to companies. Is\\nthe discovery the work of the singular
      individual, the spark of genius\\nand deep matter expertise that shed light
      on what would have otherwise\\nremained in darkness -- the 'Einstein' type of
      explorer? Or is the\\ndiscovery like making landfall on a distant shore, a shore
      that this\\njust a small part of potentially an entire continent, the exploration
      of\\nwhich will require effort and time by many -- the 'Columbus' type?\\n\\n###
      The four I's\\n\\nIn university technology transfer settings, the key interactions
      and\\npatent licensing negotiations between the university and company usually\\nevolve
      around the patented *invention*. The university researcher works\\nfrom *idea*
      to invention and company R&D departments pick up the\\ninvention and turn it
      into *innovation*. This invention, often laid down\\nin a patent application,
      is a central element of the transfer. Although\\nthe patent is arguably often
      the capstone for the know-how and\\ncommitment of the inventors, it plays a
      central role in university\\ntechnology transfer. Granting a company access
      to such an invention,\\nthrough a license or some other arrangement, is one
      of the defining\\ntransactions in technology transfer and often a bone of contention
      for\\nmany involved, researchers, technology transfer managers, entrepreneurs,\\nand
      *investors*.\\n\\nThese people, usually overseen by the respective executive
      management\\nlayers, are the negotiation parties that have to strike the arrangements\\nthat
      result in the intended transfer. That is not always a smooth and\\nstraightforward
      process: their different backgrounds and goals lead to\\nasymmetric information
      distribution, misunderstandings, and friction.\\nEven the corporate R&D staff
      are prone to this, as the context in which\\nthey operate is very different
      from academic research environments. The\\ndifference is not the science underlying
      all their work but the\\nprocesses, aims and structures of the organizations
      that drive and aim\\ntheir work. The researcher's place in their respective
      organizations,\\nand their R&D objectives, sets them apart when it comes to
      role, goal\\nand responsibility within the tech transfer negotiation processes.\\n\\nSuch
      fundamental differences in perspectives between universities and\\ncompanies
      are not always fully recognized, which also play out at the\\nnegotiation table.
      Take for example terminology. Although the term 'R&D'\\nis used by both sides
      to describe their work, the actual activities will\\ndiffer markedly. Moreover,
      a lot of university researchers will claim\\nthey are 'innovating' but their
      use of this catch-all term refers to\\n'newness' in general, rather the more
      apt definition of an innovation in\\neconomic settings and the business sector:
      producing a 'new or improved\\nproduct or process for the marketplace'. In other
      words, innovations are\\nproduced by industry and it is the company that creates
      significant\\neconomic value -- not the university.\\n\\n### Three more I's\\n\\nTo
      better understand the complexity of university technology transfer it\\nis important
      to understand the 'human factor' dimension, especially the\\nrole of the university
      researcher who has made the invention. Most\\nresearchers or professors at a
      university lack extensive direct\\nexperience with industry R&D or business
      practices. Similarly, the\\ncolleagues of the company researchers are usually
      not very familiar with\\nthe culture and processes at a university and struggle
      to understand the\\nuniversity and its peculiar ways.\\n\\nThis university researcher,
      the Einstein, not only came up with the idea\\nbut also contributes in-depth
      expertise on the topic and access to a\\nnetwork of other experts. Especially
      in the case of a first patent\\napplication, and the tentative nature of the
      new invention, the company\\nwants her to be part of their corporate R&D process.
      Such inventors may\\nnot see themselves as subordinates to university management
      and\\ntransfers of researchers (and their grant funding) is common; their\\ninterests
      and perspective may not align with the university's\\nperspective. However,
      the university owns the right to the invention,\\nmaking them an inseparable
      part of any tech transfer arrangement with\\nthe company.\\n\\nConsequently,
      'I, the researcher', 'I, the university' and 'I, the\\ncompany', often have
      to enter into what amounts to a trilateral\\nrelationship within license negotiation
      positions.\\n\\n### It takes two to tango, but three can be a crowd\\n\\nResearch
      shows that these three groups tend to have strong opinions of\\neach other,
      owing to their different perspectives, objectives and\\ninterests. Where the
      university and technology transfer managers see\\nthemselves as brokers, the
      researchers lament their lack of technical\\nexpertise, while the companies
      complain about the lack of market acumen.\\nThe researchers consider their invention
      the crucial link to new,\\ninnovative products, while the company sees one of
      multiple routes to a\\nnew product, and the university sees a publicly funded
      asset to be\\nexploited. Managing the financially risky development process
      by the\\ncompany is perceived by entrepreneurs and investors as a complex step\\ntowards
      innovation, while the researcher sees a straightforward path\\nfrom 'invention
      to innovation', and the university may want to avoid a\\nPR risk in being seen
      as perhaps too involved in commercial activities\\nrather than its two core
      institutional missions (education and\\nresearch). The organization's structure
      and culture impact the\\nperception of management and authority. Large organizations,
      be it\\ncorporates or universities, operate on different speeds compared to\\neager
      startup companies and enterprising individual professors.\\n\\nAll of this leads
      to different views between the three 'I's' engaged in\\nthe negotiations on
      tech transfer rewards and risks. The difference\\nbetween 'Einstein' and 'Columbus'
      is the negotiated compensation. The\\nformer is an individual of unique creativity,
      the latter is a team\\nplayer who reached his goal because through perseverance
      that. The value\\nof a unique idea versus the first step of a long and winding
      road is\\ndifferent. The role and importance of university technology transfer
      for\\nall of the 'I's', from the professor's idea and the company's innovation\\nis
      an important value-creating trajectory; for the university it is\\nperceived
      to be a tertiary function at best and one that comes with PR\\nrisks. Think
      of, for example, a professor suddenly the proud owner of an\\nexpensive car
      paid for by income generated from university technology\\ntransfer.\\n\\nWhile
      one can lament the university's risk-averse culture and the\\nfriction it may
      create for university technology transfer, the\\nchallenge-driven academic research
      culture also fosters creativity,\\nindependent thought and critical thinking\_--
      traits that are highly\\nvalued in Western society and values that universities
      are expected to\\nteach their students. Students who may also find employment
      in those\\nsame innovative companies. The duality of culture that makes it\\ndifficult
      to cross the 'public/private' divide and collaborate with\\ncompanies in the
      private sector, but also worthwhile in terms of\\neconomic gains and societal
      benefits. Of course many sensible people\\nrecognize that finding a middle ground
      is necessary and crucial. As Lita\\nNelsen, the former Director of the MIT Technology
      Licensing Office,\\nnoted on the nature of tech transfer: \\\"It's not a business,
      but run it\\nlike a business\\\".\\n\\n### The I in information gap\\n\\nBut
      what does that mean; to run it like a business? To make university\\ntechnology
      transfer processes more efficient and effective, it is\\nimportant to move beyond
      generalized opinions and misperceptions.\\nPractice does not make perfect, but
      accumulating experience in tech\\ntransfer offers guidelines and creates valuable
      expertise for\\npractitioners. But to really improve university technology transfer,\\nsome
      issues need to be made more explicit and information gaps need to\\nbe filled
      in order to have the I's come together.\\n\\nCrucially, it is important to move
      beyond the general understandings of\\ntechnology transfer negotiation processes
      into the nitty-gritty\\nspecifics of those interactions. Detailed analyses may
      generate new\\ninsights that can not only benefit new entrants in tech transfer,
      but\\nalso inform experienced practitioners on both sides of the fence -- both\\ncompanies
      and universities. This is the topic of ongoing research which\\ntakes individual
      cases as a starting point. Looking into the perspective\\nof all the 'I's' of
      a patent licensing negotiation. It aims to identify\\nthe intentions, perceptions
      and the information gap between the various\\nnegotiating parties and their
      stakeholders. To test hypotheses based on\\nthose case studies a survey has
      been designed which will be distributed\\nin October among interested parties
      through a variety of networks.\\n\\n*This blog post is part of my ongoing PhD

      Project\\n5top100](https://www.5top100.ru/en/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}[](https://www.5top100.ru/en/)\\nis
      a Russian excellence initiative in higher education that ran from\\n2013 to
      2020. The aim of the initiative was to place five Russian\\nuniversities in
      the top 100 of global university rankings. The goal was\\nnot achieved; in political
      and academic discourses, there are\\nconflicting assessments of the results
      of the project. On the one hand,\\nthe main goal of the project was not achieved;
      no five project\\nparticipants got into the top 100 of the most common global
      university\\nrankings (here we mean ARWU, THE and QS rankings). On the other
      hand,\\nthe Accounts Chamber (official auditor of the state budget) noted that\\nthe
      implementation of the 5top100 project made it possible to form a\\ngroup of
      leading universities in the country, as well as to integrate\\nRussia into the
      global trends in the implementation of academic\\nexcellence programs and strengthen
      the scale and significance of Russian\\nuniversity science in the world. We
      tried to look at the problem from\\ninside the university.\\n\\nThe Ural Federal
      University has been involved in the project from the\\nvery beginning. The main
      mechanism for bringing public funding to the\\nfinal recipients was the creation
      and development of research groups.\\nThis scheme was typical for most of the
      participants of the 5top100\\nproject. To the best of our knowledge, [our\\nwork](https://journals.urfu.ru/index.php/r-economy/article/view/6069){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\noffers
      the first study of the results of the implementation of the\\nexcellence initiative
      not at the level of universities, but at the level\\nof research units. This
      approach was made possible thanks to the\\navailability of structured data for
      the period 2014-2020 provided by the\\nDepartment of Strategic Development and
      Marketing.\\n\\n### **Key results**\\n\\nIn total, the analysis included performance
      indicators of 79 research\\ngroups. The number of articles indexed in Scopus
      and Web of Science was\\nused as the main indicator. As an alternative indicator
      of quality, we\\nused the number of articles in journals with an impact factor
      above two.\\nUnfortunately, disciplinary features were not taken into account
      in the\\nprocess of research assessment, so the threshold was the same for all\\ngroups.
      Correlation analysis revealed a moderate positive relationship\\nbetween the
      dynamics of these two indicators (0.56); thus, we refuted\\nthe widely held
      assumption that stimulating quantitative growth of\\npublications necessarily
      leads to a decrease in their quality. Our\\nresults indirectly support the existence
      of [constant or increasing\\nmarginal returns for most research\\nareas](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0166149){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nThe
      amount of funding was set annually depending on the type of group\\nand the
      performance for the previous period. The type of group (research\\ngroup, research
      laboratory, center of excellence) was determined\\ndepending on the number and
      level of group members. Paradoxically,\\nfunding (current and previous) does
      not have a significant effect on the\\nchange in research group productivity.
      Moreover, in some cases there was\\nan inverse relationship. We can assume that
      in this case, prospective\\nfunding plays a more significant role than current
      level of funding. For\\nexample, a decrease in funding forces a group to work
      harder in the hope\\nof increasing funding in the future. It is important to
      note that this\\nvariable refers exclusively to government funding. In terms
      of R&D\\nrevenue, we found an inverse relationship: the more R&D revenue, the\\nsmaller
      the increase in the number of articles. Thus, we can state that\\npublications
      and innovative activities (measured as R&D income in our\\ncase) in research
      groups are substituting, not complementary.\\n\\nNo less surprising is the fact
      that the experience of the research\\nleader of the group also has an inverse
      relationship with the increase\\nin performance. This does not mean that groups
      with an experienced\\nleader have poor results, quite the contrary. However,
      the results of\\nsuch groups tend to be stable rather than growing.\\n\\nOur
      study showed that the main factor influencing research productivity\\nis the
      size of the research group. The age of the project, defined as\\nthe period
      of time from the establishment of a group to the termination\\nof its operation,
      is also important. Note that we performed separate\\nanalyses for social and
      humanities areas (15 of the 79 groups) and all\\nothers. Interestingly, the
      age of the group has the greatest\\nsignificance for both models in the social
      sciences and humanities\\nfields with either the number of articles or articles
      in the journals\\nwith IF \\\\> 2 as dependent variables. We attribute this
      to the fact that\\nthere are fewer journals in these areas (purely humanities
      journals do\\nnot have an impact factor in principle); respectively, it takes
      more\\ntime to accumulate publications in top journals. Moreover, it simply\\ntakes
      more time to publish anything in these fields compared to natural\\nand technical
      sciences. Thus, we can conclude that social sciences and\\nhumanities projects
      require a longer planning horizon so that one can\\nsee the effects from funding.\\n\\nIn
      conclusion, our study found that:\\n\\n- The main factors affecting the performance
      of research teams are the\\n  number of participants and the age of the project
      (the latter\\n  especially for social sciences and humanities)\\n- Funding (current
      and previous) has no impact on performance, although\\n  it certainly affects
      the ability to hire more team members\\n- Decrease in current funding can paradoxically
      increase productivity\\n- Experienced researchers are more likely to create
      stable rather than\\n  rapidly developing groups in terms of publication activity\\n-
      Publication and R&D activities are at least partly substituting\\n  towards
      each other\\n\\nThe study focused on one university, and the number of research
      groups\\nis relatively small. Comparative analysis and expansion of the empirical\\nbase
      will provide more meaningful results in the future. For example, it\\nwill be
      interesting to compare the performance of research groups across\\ndifferent
      disciplines in a larger sample.\_Another limitation is that\\nonly two databases
      (Scopus and Web of Science) were used in the\\nevaluation procedure and in this
      study\_as well. The results obtained are\\nhighly dependent on the sources of
      bibliometric data. This study mainly\\ncovered quantitative performance indicators
      but did not touch upon other\\nproject outcomes such as increased academic mobility
      and foreign\\nrecruitment.\\n\\n### **Concluding reflections**\\n\\nOur study
      showed that the 5top100 project empowered a dramatic increase\\nin the number
      of publications by Russian scientists in international\\ndatabases. This statement
      is true for both a particular university and\\nthe country as a whole. Below
      is the statistics of publications for\\n2013-2020 for the Ural Federal University,
      participants of the 5top100\\nproject, and Russia.**  \\n**\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Figure1_new_2022-08-06-092417_jctn.png\\\"\\nalt=\\\"Figure1
      new\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\nIn the end, I would like to return to where I started
      this post, i.e.,\\nto the project 5top100. In my opinion, the Project failed
      to solve two\\nmajor problems of Russian higher education. First, there remains
      a\\nmonstrous gap between the budgets of the world\\\\'s leading universities\\nand
      Russian universities. Universities should have a more balanced\\nfunding structure
      with more private participation, for example in the\\nform of revenue from R&D.
      It is impossible to solve this problem solely\\nat the expense of public funds,
      and the demand for university research\\nproducts (first of all, innovations)
      from the leading Russian companies\\nis still at a consistently low level. The
      reality is that most of the\\nscience-intensive products are purchased abroad,
      with the only exception\\nfor the military complex. Secondly, the 5 top100 project
      did not lead to\\ninstitutional changes within the universities and in the national
      higher\\neducation system. All changes were implemented in the traditional rigid\\nvertical
      with no real autonomy of universities (all project participants\\nare state
      universities) and decentralization within universities. The\\nquality of academic
      institutions, and first of all, academic freedom\\ndetermines academic excellence,
      in my opinion. Therefore, it will be\\ninteresting to observe not only the research
      performance issues under\\nthe new [Priority 2030\\nproject](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/priority-2030-the-new-excellence-initiative-from-russia){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nbut
      also how the new program will cope with these two challenges.\\n\\n*This text

      Due to our different\\ndisciplinary backgrounds, we exchanged ideas on a wide
      variety of\\nresearch topics, which had a very special significance for us in
      the\\nsummer school. Among other topics, we talked about translational\\npsychotherapy,
      the role of gender in solar energy research in Turkey,\\npublic policies in
      Latin America, and public research\_institutions in\\nKorea. We talked about
      the terms \\\\\\\"ultrafine particles and\\nnanoparticles\\\\\\\", and \\\\\\\"elderly
      independent living\\\\\\\" as well as broader\\ntopics such as education policy
      during the COVID-19 pandemic and health\\ndata sharing. Although we focussed
      mainly on scientometric methods,\\nthere was no lack of diversity in the way
      to apply them: we looked at\\ncitation behavior, talked about the development
      of new indicators, the\\nrelationship between survey data and bibliographic
      data, and learned\\nmore about grant proposals, delayed recognition in science,
      and the\\nquantification of adjacent in distant reuse of references within\\ndisciplines.\\n\\n###
      Global summer school: a hybrid experience\\n\\nThis edition of the CWTS Summer
      School was the first to offer a hybrid\\nlearning experience, and like all first
      times, it brought a few\\nchallenges. Still, the hybrid mode enriched diversity
      by including\\nparticipants who otherwise could not have enjoyed the summer
      school. We\\ncould classify the challenges into two main categories: unexpected\\ncomical
      MS Teams happenings and issues related to technicalities. On the\\ncomical side,
      we encountered unintentional unmuting and cat appearances,\\nand on the technical
      side, we sometimes experienced poor connections and\\nsound issues. However,
      all challenges were professionally managed by the\\nteachers, not affecting
      the rhythm and pace of the summer school. One\\non-site participant said: \\\\\\\"I
      found the hybrid format very enriching.\\nGetting to know Leiden and the CWTS
      on site was great, but equally great\\nwere the digital presentations and the
      enrichment of the discussions\\nprovided by those connected online. Apart from
      the content of this\\ncourse, networking and being able to exchange were the
      two\_main\\narguments for me to take part in the summer school - there was nothing\\nelse
      to be desired.\\\"\\n\\nFrom the perspective of the online participants, the
      hybrid environment\\nfelt like being in a movie; there were camera-shifting
      angles and\\nzoom-in to participants speaking in person. Also, the teachers
      managed\\nthe time for Q&A and discussion equally for all participants. In\\nconclusion,
      although online participants were not in the room, their\\nvaluable contributions
      showed the importance of bringing their voices\\ninto this edition of the summer
      school.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/IMG_20220701_153030.jpg\\\"\\nalt=\\\"IMG

      summer school came just at the right time when most of the\\nparticipants needed
      it. Indeed, it came at a point where most of us are\\nworking on metric-related
      studies but needed a broader understanding and\\nto\_learn more about the distinctions
      between scientometrics,\\nbibliometrics, and altmetrics. Discussions and clarifications
      on these\\napproaches and on methods applied to diverse types of studies benefited\\nmost
      participants. Participants who got the opportunity to present their\\nwork-in-progress
      received comments from fellow participants which in\\nreturn aided in improving
      their work.\\n\\nAccording to one participant: \\\"The summer school helped
      me to address\\ncritical comments of reviewers regarding the \\\\'methodology\\\\'
      section of\\nan article about the impact of international collaboration on Namibian\\nscience
      production\\\\\\\".\\n\\nAll the information on data sources and different tools
      used in\\nscientometric studies provided during this course is a bonus that
      will\\nenrich the future scientometric-related studies of all participants.\\nAdditionally,
      free access to data sources such as the ICSR Lab and\\nDimensions on Google
      Big Query will provide an opportunity for\\nparticipants to use data for further
      exploration in metric-related\\nstudies. Empowered by the knowledge gained at
      the summer school, we look\\nforward to expanding the frontiers of scientometric
      research together in\\nthe future.\\n\\n~Photo by\_[Deleece\\nCook](https://unsplash.com/@deleece){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}~\\n\",\"published_at\":1660204800,\"updated_at\":1708703227,\"indexed_at\":1708118022,\"authors\":[{\"name\":

      explains what these projects are about and what CWTS has learned\\nfrom working
      at the science-society interface.  \\n\\n### RRI & SMART Specialisation {#rri-smart-specialisation}\\n\\nThe
      core concept in both projects is\\n[RRI](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346632810_Monitoring_Responsible_Research_and_Innovation_in_the_European_research_area){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThis
      policy approach anticipates and assesses potential implications and\\nsocietal
      expectations with regard to research and innovation, with the\\naim to foster
      the design of inclusive and sustainable research and\\ninnovation. It implies
      that societal actors (researchers, citizens,\\npolicy makers, business, third
      sector organisations, etc.) work together\\nduring the whole research and innovation
      process in order to better\\nalign both the process and its outcomes with the
      values, needs and\\nexpectations of society. In practice, RRI is implemented
      as a package\\nthat includes multi-actor and [public engagement in research
      and\\ninnovation](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/node/766){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nRRI
      thus enables easier access to scientific results, the take up of\\ngender equality
      and ethics in the research and innovation content and\\nprocesses, and formal
      and informal science education. RRI actions such\\nas fostering co-creation
      and demand driven R&I in an open and\\nresponsible way can be a complex matter
      due to the plurality of actors\\ninvolved and the socio-cultural divergences
      between the different\\ngeographical areas in Europe. However, it can also be
      a great\\nopportunity for growth if it is done effectively. However, neither
      the\\ntheory, policy nor practice of RRI pays attention to the spatial\\ndimension
      of research and innovation processes. As a consequence, RRI\\npractices often
      ignore the various ways in which regional context\\naffects not only the development
      of innovation but also the perception\\nof what is responsible and socially
      desirable.\\n\\n'[Smart\\nSpecialisation](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09654313.2019.1645814){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}'\\nis
      an innovation policy concept intended to promote the efficient and\\neffective
      use of public investment in research. Its goal is to boost\\nregional (territorial)
      science and innovation in order to achieve\\neconomic growth and prosperity,
      by enabling regions to pursue new\\ndevelopments by making use of their local
      strengths. It has been gaining\\nimportance for innovation policy because of
      the role of proximity and\\nthe presence of knowledge-related institutions in
      associated fields are\\nthought to have a positive influence. Thereby, the smart
      specialisation\\nstrategy\\n([RIS3](https://s3platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/home){target=\\\"_blank\\\"})\\nprogramme
      is the most ambitious and endowed approach of EU-funded\\nterritorial innovation
      policies so far. However, the potential\\nimplications and societal expectations
      with regard to research and\\ninnovation have often been ignored in the smart
      specialisation discourse\\nand the entrepreneurial development process that
      should support S3.\\n\\nThe European Commission recently launched the new smart
      specialisation\\npolicy framework; S4. S4 specifically focuses on sustainable
      innovation,\\nwhich aims at demand driven social innovation that should bring
      long\\nlasting systemic changes and green innovation to the European regions.\\nThis
      requires not only a well-designed priority portfolio tailored to\\nthe region,
      but also active participation from regional actors and a\\nregional learning
      process. The concept of regional participation,\\nexperimentation and initiatives
      to achieve desired social transformative\\nchange originates from the third
      frame of innovation policy, regarded in\\nliterature as the most recent paradigm
      in which to view innovation\\npolicy (distinguished from two earlier framings
      related to R&D and\\nnational systems of innovation). These social transformations
      that S4\\ntargets are often very complex with many stakeholders involved, take\\nplace
      on different levels of society and are of systemic nature.\\nTherefore, S4 calls
      for a directional systemic approach in which a\\ndiverse set of local actors
      determine the directions to take\\ncollectively. To support regions in this
      process, methodologies, tools\\nand workshop formats have to be developed to
      guide regions in for\\ninstance stakeholder engagement, regional mapping, target
      setting,\\nworking backwards from goals, and reflection and evaluation. The\\nEuropean
      Commission is working on the S4 Playbook in which these type of\\napproaches
      are collected to assist the regions here. Although a helpful\\nsupport, regions
      will likely differ a lot in their nature, needs and\\nquestions, which means
      that often a case to case assessment is required.\\n\\n### RRI X SMART SPEC
      (S4)\\n\\nIt is especially in S4 that smart specialisation and RRI can be well\\naligned,
      given that both concepts address demand driven, social and\\ninclusive developments
      in a participatory process involving regional\\nactors. Combining the two concepts
      has the potential to better align\\nresearch with local societal demands and
      to bring new research insights\\nto society more effectively. This combination
      is a new one that\\n[CWTS](https://www.cwts.nl/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} has
      implemented in both\\n[CHERRIES](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects/cherries){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand\\n[RIPEET](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects/ripeet){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nby
      conducting a mixed method approach. On the one hand regional data was\\ncollected
      on scientific output, technological development, actors and\\npolicy programs.
      On the other hand regional discussion groups were\\norganised in which all types
      of regional actors could voice their\\ninnovation needs and ideas as well as
      comment upon the collected\\nregional data. This was very much an iterative
      process in which we went\\nback and forth between the data and regional actors
      multiple time.\\nNevertheless, in the end we ended up with a comprehensive overview
      of\\nthe regional innovation ecosystem of which the data was screened by\\nregional
      actors and in which the societal needs voiced by the regional\\nactors could
      be evaluated by the regional data.\\n\\n### Expertise at\_CWTS\\n\\n[CWTS](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nis
      very well positioned to conduct this type of analysis, as it had\\nexpertise
      in multiple related areas. In the first place CWTS is a mixed\\nmethod institute
      with both quantitative and qualitative expertise, which\\nfits this type of
      analysis well. It also has been involved in many\\nrelated projects focusing
      on topics like the sustainable development\\ngoals\\n([STRINGS](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/past-projects/strings){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}),\\nparticipatory
      processes (Knowledge Ecosystems), scientific and\\ntechnological data analysis\\n([RISIS](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/past-projects/risis){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}),\\ninnovation
      dynamics ([H2020\\nprojects](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/past-projects/newhorrizon){target=\\\"_blank\\\"})\\nand
      development of a monitoring framework for responsible R&I practices\\n([SUPER\\nMoRRI](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects/supermorri){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\nAn
      approach that combines these elements enables CWTS to put its\\nknowledge and
      expertise in practice and support transitions that benefit\\nsociety. Moreover,
      participating in such projects helps to align the\\nresearch conducted at the
      institute with present-day questions that\\narise in societal, scientific and
      policy communities.\\n\\n### EXPLORE\\n\\nIn order to facilitate local knowledge
      production and experimentation\\nthat help regions to create more sustainable
      and inclusive societies,\\nCWTS recently launched the EXPLORE (EX(ploring) P(articipatory)
      L(ocal)\\nO(pen) responsible R(&I) E(cosystems) methodology. As the acronym\\nsuggests,
      it combines the fundamental building blocks of RRI and S4 into\\nan accessible
      R&I approach. We do this by integrating heterogeneous\\nelements like group
      workshops, process evaluation and territorial\\nmapping under the same methodological
      umbrella in a modular format. This\\nmodular format enables us to select the
      specific elements that a given\\nterritorial societal demand requires, thus
      making the approach very\\nflexible to any kind of territory or challenge. Moreover,
      this approach\\nhelps to avoid the \\\"one policy fits all\\\" pitfall by enabling
      a bottom-up\\napproach and taking the region specific situation as the starting
      point\\nof each assessment. The EXPLORE methodology enables CWTS to be more\\ninvolved
      in local and regional experimentation and innovation, the\\nco-creation of new
      priority targets and policy mixes, the [monitoring\\nand evaluation](https://repository.fteval.at/604/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      of\\nthese processes, and social transformative change in general.\\n\\n###
      What includes EXPLORE\\n\\nThe modular building blocks in EXPLORE can be stored
      under three main\\nimportant innovation processes: Mapping, priority setting
      & [transition\\nprocess](https://repository.fteval.at/603/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      and\\nmonitoring & evaluation (M&E).\\n\\nFirstly, EXPLORE can help territories
      to get an overview of their R&I\\nlandscape by offering different **mapping**
      analyses. This is an\\nimportant understanding for governments and societal
      actors alike,\\nbecause it provides the basis from which new plans, strategies,\\nexperiments
      and innovation in general can be developed. Among these\\nanalyses are for instance
      stakeholder discussion sessions that identify\\nbarriers and opportunities in
      the R&I system together with the local\\nactors. Also the policy landscape can
      be analysed to identify what\\nopportunities for experimentation already exist
      and where gaps may be\\nfound that should be addressed. Lastly, EXPLORE also
      offers extensive\\ndata analysis of the regional knowledge landscape based on
      publication\\nand patent output with visualisations that show in a glance where
      the\\nrelative capabilities of the territory are located in a given innovation\\nfield.
      One such approach is the Science Landscape, as shown below for\\nthe energy
      field in Extremadura.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Extremadura-energy-map-720.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"28368\\\"
      />\\n</figure>\\n\\n  \\nSecondly, EXPLORE can also assist in **priority setting**
      and in the\\n**transition process** itself. The included tools help government
      and\\nlocal actors to make difficult choices, approach complex challenges\\noutside
      their usual scope and initiate experimentation. It can provide\\nhints for prioritisation
      compliant to the smart specialisation rationale\\nbased on local knowledge data
      analysis that should then be combined with\\nlocal actor input. It provides
      further assistance tools by a wide\\nvariety of workshop options to get closer
      to the desired priorities and\\noutcomes. Among these are for instance workshops
      that structure the\\nlocal needs present, visioning workshops that constitute
      a vision of\\nwhat could be achieved and backcasting exercises that work out
      how to\\nget to a desired future. In all these workshops participants are\\nchallenged
      to keep an open mind, local actors are heavily involved and\\nexercises are
      flexible to adhere to the local context.\\n\\n<figure style=\\\"width:100%;
      text-align:center;\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/20220914_1_Picture2.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"27342\\\"\\nalt=\\\"CHERRIES
      Policy Labs session in Brussels (May 2022)\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\n[*CHERRIES
      Policy Labs session in Brussels (May 2022)  \\n*]{.caption}\\n\\nLastly, EXPLORE
      can assist in the **monitoring and evaluation** of\\nongoing prioritisation
      and experimentation. Monitoring and evaluation is\\ncrucial in every innovation
      process, as it checks whether the process is\\non track to reach its desired
      goals, participating actors are still on\\nthe same page and makes sure that
      the right changes can be made on the\\nfly in a dynamic process. EXPLORE includes
      a wide spectrum of activities\\nthat can be deployed in this regard. These range
      from short and frequent\\nlike monitoring discussions or expert and stakeholder
      interviews to more\\nintensive like on-site monitoring visits and impact workshops.
      M&E is\\nguided by evaluative conversations rather than following up a set of\\nindicators.
      The impact workshops can be general, but can also be more\\nspecific on a certain
      aspect where impact is challenging or highly\\ndesired to reach more specific
      feedback and results.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nIn a nutshell, with EXPLORE CWTS
      wishes to make the valuable insights of\\nS4 and RRI more accessible and easier
      to apply in a practical context.\\nThis will give territories a stronger basis
      to develop successful and\\nsustainable initiatives that serve society. Combined
      with a\\nparticipatory transition process this has the potential to open more\\nopportunity
      for experimentation and social initiatives. Hopefully, this\\nwill accelerate
      the transformation that all territories in Europe\\ndesperately strive for while
      strengthening local interests.  \\n\",\"published_at\":1664958600,\"updated_at\":1708703227,\"indexed_at\":1708118022,\"authors\":[{\"name\":

      number, respiratory\\ndroplets and so on. Experts from medicine and other scientific

      A\\nscientific-technical committee was established to advise the government,\\nwhile
      medical doctors and scientists were routinely interviewed in\\nnewspapers and
      invited in talk shows.\\n\\nIn this context, on May 2 the newspaper *Il Tempo*
      published an\\n[article](https://www.ilcorrieredelgiorno.it/gli-esperti-piu-scarsi-del-mondo-burioni-pregliasco-e-brusaferro/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nbearing
      the title: \\\"The poorest experts in the world: Burioni,\\nPregliasco and Brusaferro\\\".[\\\\[1\\\\]](#_ftn1){#footnote-1-ref}
      In this\\narticle, the *scientific reliability* of several experts taking part
      in\\nthe scientific-technical committee or appearing in the media was gauged\\nusing
      the most (in)famous bibliometric indicator, the h-index. Experts\\nwere ranked
      and licenses of expertise attributed or discarded based on\\nh-index scores.
      The journalist explained:  \\n\\nThe frankly crude use of the h-index made in
      the article attracted much\\ncriticism from the Italian scientific community
      (see\\n[here](https://m.facebook.com/pattotrasversaleperlascienza/posts/2269510433344522){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_and\\n[here](http://www.pellegrinoconte.com/2020/05/02/credibilita-scientifica-e-h-index/?fbclid=IwAR3dw1ir3aU2PkTl3Motnla2OgK09OejtRxSZ779Uxe5g3Phd8yT7N-7Da0){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nsources
      in Italian). On my part, I was deeply impressed by how a\\nspecialized notion
      from bibliometrics *percolated* in the generalist\\npress and was *mobilized*
      in public debates on scientific authority and\\ntrustworthiness of experts.
      I was aware that bibliometricians and\\nscholars in STS were increasingly revealing
      the performative nature of\\nbibliometric indicators: far from being neutral
      measures, these\\nstatistical constructs [shape the behavior of\\nscientists](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0221212){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      deeply [intrude into the epistemic structure of the sciences\\nthemselves](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thomas-Franssen/publication/288856380_Evaluation_practices_and_effects_of_indicator_use-a_literature_review/links/5796397508aeb0ffcd058786/Evaluation-practices-and-effects-of-indicator-use-a-literature-review.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nHowever,
      this kind of research had so far mainly focused on\\nintra-scientific contexts
      and practices, with little attention for\\nextra-scientific arenas. Yet, the
      article mentioned above seemed to me a\\nclear example of how academic/scientific
      actors are *notalone* in\\ngenerating the *socialrepresentation* of bibliometric
      indicators: a\\ncomplete description of the processes of negotiating meaning
      should\\nencompass further actors, such as journalists, and further arenas,
      such\\nas the press.\\n\\nI then started a research project aiming at investigating
      the\\nrepresentations and uses of bibliometrics in the press, with the aim of\\ndeveloping
      the [previous\\nclassifications](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-016-2150-8){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nof
      relevant actors. I decided to focus on the Italian press for two\\nreasons.
      First, Italy's research evaluation system is heavily based on\\nbibliometric
      indicators. This system was introduced in 2010 as part of a\\nvast reform of
      the country's university management, which was heavily\\ncontested by the Italian
      academic community. Second, Italy lacks a\\nstrong indigenous community of bibliometrics
      experts. In this sense, no\\ncommunity could claim an *epistemic control* of
      the social discourse on\\nbibliometrics in the country. These factors created
      the conditions for\\nnewspapers to become a key arena for the discussion of
      bibliometrics and\\nbibliometric indicators and, hence, a perfect viewpoint
      to observe the\\ncollective construction of their social representation.\\n\\nUsing
      the online archives of four major Italian newspapers, I retrieved\\na corpus
      of 583 articles, published between 1990 and 2020, that\\nmentioned the Journal
      Impact Factor, the h-index, or other\\nbibliometrics-related terms. In this
      blog post I cannot go into the\\ndetails of this very rich material.[\\\\[2\\\\]](#footnote-2){#footnote-2-ref}\\nI
      will try, however, to highlight what I deem to be the three most\\ninteresting
      findings and suggest some ideas for further research.\\n\\n### Indicators in
      the press between meritocracy, science news, and rankings\\n\\nThe first result
      is that the Impact Factor (IF, in the following)\\nstarted to appear in the
      Italian press in news about *scandals in\\ncompetitions for university chairs*.
      In the early 1990s, it become\\ncommon practice to sum the IF of the journals
      in which scientists\\npublished, obtaining an IF-based metric of individual
      researchers. In\\nthis way, candidates rejected in competitions had at their
      disposal a\\nnew, easily interpretable metric to compare their scientific performance\\nwith
      that of the winners and, thus, could reclaim justice. In this\\nsense, the IF
      started its career in the Italian press as a \\\"justice\\ndevice\\\" to *promote
      meritocracy* in academic recruitment. The following\\nquote is representative
      of the general tone of the news denouncing\\nscandals:  \\n\\nThe rhetorical
      use of indicators as objective measures that can fix the\\nperceived endemic
      clientelism of Italian academy grows over the years\\nand reaches its highest
      intensity in the years before the implementation\\nof the 2010 university reform
      (Figure 1).\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Figure_1.png\\\"\\nalt=\\\"Fig
      1 petrovich\\\" />\\n<figcaption>Figure 1 - Articles presenting bibliometric
      indicators as a\\nmeans to promote meritocracy in the Italian university system.
      Figure\\nadapted from the published article.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nThis
      shows that indicators were integrated into a *meritocracy-centered\\nnarrative
      frame* long before they were officially enrolled in the\\nItalian research evaluation
      system.\\n\\nThe second finding, which is particularly relevant for understanding
      how\\nthe press contributes to the social construction of scientific facts,
      is\\nthat the Impact Factor is frequently used by journalists as a \\\"quality\\nseal\\\"
      for science news. The IF is presented as a warrant of the\\n*scientific reliability*
      of the venue of publication, and hence, of the\\ncredibility or relevance of
      the science news reported:  \\n\\nNote that no article where the IF plays this
      function mentions the\\nlimitations of the indicator, that hence is presented
      as a completely\\n\\\"transparent\\\" quality seal, easily interpretable and
      uncontested.\\n\\nInterestingly, the IF can be mobilized also to *deconstruct*
      the\\nvalidity of research in the news. For instance, the reliability of a\\nstudy
      allegedly showing the efficacy of homeopathy is contested based on\\nthe IF
      factor of the publishing journal, observing that this was \\\"very\\nlow\\\"
      compared to that of serious scientific journals such as *Nature*.\\n\\nThe third
      interesting result concerns the role of *amateur\\nbibliometrics* in the press,
      that is bibliometrics produced by\\nnonprofessional bibliometricians. The h-index
      arrives in the Italian\\npress in 2008, just three years after its creation
      by Jorge Hirsch. The\\n\\\"vector\\\" of the indicator was a ranking of Italian
      scientists known as\\n\\\"Top Italian Scientists\\\" (TIS), [published online\\nby](https://topitalianscientists.org/home){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      the\\nassociation Virtual Italian Academy. In 2010 and 2011, most of the\\narticles
      that mentioned the indicator were in fact about the TIS. This\\nranking offered
      journalists a ranking of individual scientists that\\nnicely complemented rankings
      of universities that started popping up in\\nthe press in the same years. However,
      it was the result of a private\\ninitiative without institutional support. Again,
      about one out of three\\nof the news about the TIS ranking lack any definition
      of the indicator\\nand less than the half report its limitations.\\n\\nThese
      three findings show that bibliometric indicators in the press\\noccur in different
      contexts, play a wide range of functions, and are\\nintegrated into different
      narrative frames. They appear in debates on\\nacademic recruitment, but also
      in the communication of scientific\\ndiscoveries to the public. They can be
      used to claim justice but also to\\nsatisfy the hunger for rankings and measuring
      \\\"excellence\\\".\\n\\n### Next steps\\n\\nThe next, natural step in the investigation
      of bibliometrics in the\\npress is to understand how the social meaning of indicators
      is\\nconstructed in the press of other countries and in other media or press\\ntypes.
      It has for instance been suggested to me that Dutch journalists\\nrepresent
      the IF differently from their Italian colleagues, using it as\\na \\\"shorthand\\\"
      for any bibliometric statistics. In this research, I\\nanalyzed the generalist
      press, but there is also a specialist press,\\nsuch as Times Higher Education,
      or specialist blogs, such as [Leiden\\nMadtrics](https://leidenmadtrics.nl/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      and [ROARS\\n(Return on Academic\\nResearch)](https://www.roars.it/online/who-we-are/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      in\\nwhich the representation of indicators may follow different logics.\\nBibliometrics
      in press has still lots to tell.  \\n\\n[[\\\\[1\\\\]](#footnote-1-ref){#_ftn1}

      forms this type of partnership can adopt are not so clear for\\nevery junior-faculty,
      administrators, and from there to the\\ntop-management in the higher education
      sector. In addition, the\\nlandscape of Industry-University partnerships can
      get fuzzy --- not to\\nmention difficult --- given the [scarce resources dedicated
      to research\\nand development in middle and low-income\\ncountries](https://www.unesco.org/reports/science/2021/en/report-series){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nTake
      Latin America and the Caribbean as an example. There are no\\nLatin-American
      companies listed in [Clarivate\\\\'s Top-100 Global\\nInnovators](https://clarivate.com/top-100-innovators/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nIn
      addition, as of 2022 there are only two companies ranked in the\\n[SCImago Institutions\\nRanking](https://www.scimagoir.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      which assesses\\ninstitutions worldwide in terms of research performance, innovation\\noutput,
      and societal impact. Those companies were Petrobras and Estacio\\nParticipacoes
      AS. Petrobras is one of the largest companies in the\\npetroleum industry in
      the region, while Estacio Participacoes focuses on\\nprivate educational services
      in Brazil.\\n\\nGiven the absence of Latin-American private organizations in
      the global\\ninnovation sphere, it is both relevant and urgent to identify highly\\nstrategic
      research fields in regions with restricted financial resources\\nand underdeveloped
      industry ecosystems. For instance, in 2019 the\\naverage [research and development
      expenditure in the region was a mere\\n0.7%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GB.XPD.RSDV.GD.ZS?locations=XJ){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nAlso,
      it is of high value to map research fields\\nstill-to-be-explored-and-exploited
      via Industry-University partnerships.\\n\\n### Mapping the research-fronts of
      industry in Latin America and the Caribbean\\n\\nIn a [study published in the
      Journal of Information\\nScience](https://doi.org/10.1177/01655515221131796){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      I\\nidentified highly strategic research-fronts for both industry and\\nresearch
      intensive institutions, universities among them, in Latin\\nAmerica and the
      Caribbean. I applied a technique used to establish\\ninterconnections and clustering
      between knowledge domains. This\\ntechnique is called [bibliographic\\ncoupling](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.5090140103){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nThe
      bibliographic coupling approach enables us to examine the underlying\\nstructure
      of the knowledge required for researchers to produce new\\nknowledge. This technique
      is quite versatile. It can process highly\\nmultidisciplinary amounts of research
      documents, such as research on the\\n[Sustainable Development\\nGoals](https://clarivate.com/lp/navigating-the-structure-of-research-on-sustainable-development-goals-2/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nor
      the [complete set of articles published in the journal\\n*Nature*](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03308-7){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      150 years of history.\\n\\nThe approach for coupling two documents is straightforward.
      See the\\nfigure below this paragraph. Let\\\\'s suppose that I\\\\'m writing
      an article\\non biotechnology (A, in Figure 1), and you, the reader, are writing
      an\\narticle on bioeconomy (B, in Figure 1). We do not know each other.\\nHowever,
      we found an interesting article or any other type of scholarly\\ncommunication
      such as a book chapter, policy paper, and the like, on\\n*thebioeconomy of biotech*
      (C, in Figure 1). Now, we read and assess\\nthat scholarly communication, and
      decide to include it in our own study.\\nWe cite it and by that common citation
      our documents are now connected.\\nThe same applies to the fields of research
      of publication A and B:\\nBecause of A and B being connected, biotechnology
      and bioeconomy now\\nshare a link as well.  \\n\\nIn this first step, the bibliographic
      coupling detects the shared\\nreferences between research articles to interconnect
      them. Then, in a\\nsecond step, it is also feasible to interconnect the research
      field of\\nthe journals in which those articles were published, thereby assembling\\na
      network of research fields based on the research articles coupled.  \\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/bibliographic_coupling_II.png\\\"\\nalt=\\\"Bibliographic
      coupling II\\\" />\\n<figcaption>Figure 1. Bibliographic coupling.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nI
      applied this process to a sample of 13,000+ research articles indexed\\nin the
      bibliographic database\\n[Scopus](https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/scopus){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThe
      articles sourced had to be coauthored by at least one author\\naffiliated with
      an institution in Latin America and the Caribbean ---\\neither public or private
      ---, and the same author or another coauthor\\naffiliated with a private organization
      in any other country.\\n\\nAs I previously mentioned, the bibliographic coupling
      enables us to\\ninterconnect the research articles produced with industry collaboration\\nand
      the underlying structure of the knowledge required for their\\ndevelopment.
      Once these articles and the academic journals in which they\\nwere published
      were identified, I use the research fields\\\\'\\nclassification of the journals
      to assemble a research field network as\\nfollows.\\n\\nEach academic journal
      indexed in Scopus receives a classification to a\\nsingle or multiple research
      field based on the [All Science Journal\\nClassification](https://service.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/15181/supporthub/scopus/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nsystem.
      There are over 330 research fields, categorized into five areas,\\nnamely physical
      sciences, life sciences, health sciences, social\\nsciences & humanities, and
      multidisciplinary. In consequence, if two\\narticles connected via bibliographic
      coupling were published in a\\njournal with two classifications such as biotechnology
      and\\nbioengineering, and a second journal with a single classification in\\nmolecular
      medicine, the research field network based on these two\\njournals is composed
      by three interconnected fields: biotechnology,\\nbioengineering, and molecular
      medicine.\\n\\nAlso, I calculated betweenness centrality, [an\\nindicator](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-021-01222-2){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nfor
      each research field that unveils its strategic position within the\\nnetwork.
      Figure 2 shows the network layout with the research-fields with\\nhigh strategic
      position, proportional to the size of the nodes. Also, it\\nshows the time of
      the first publication of a given research-field.  \\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/research-fronts_III_880_2023-04-12-100133_cbwp.png\\\"\\nalt=\\\"Research

      Physical science, the most active. Multidisciplinary, the most strategic  {#physical-science-the-most-active.-multidisciplinary-the-most-strategic}\\n\\nResults
      showed that multiple research-fields from different research\\nareas were active
      in industry-research collaborations (further on called\\nindustry research fronts).
      Physical science had the most active role.\\nThe least active role went to social
      sciences and humanities.\\n\\nThe research area of physical science with fields
      such as computer\\nscience applications, information systems, electrical & electronic\\nengineering,
      energy engineering and power technology took about \\\\~38% of\\nthe total nodes
      of the network. Health sciences made up 23% of the\\nnodes. In this area, we
      can find research-fields such as public health,\\nenvironmental and occupational
      health, or general medicine. For the case\\nof life sciences, an area with \\\\~19%
      of the nodes, we can find\\nresearch-fields such as genetics, pharmacology,
      or agronomy and crop\\nscience. Finally, for social sciences and humanities,
      with \\\\~18% of the\\nfields, we can find fields such as strategy and management,
      geography,\\nplanning and development, or economics and econometrics.\\n\\nDespite
      having just one node in the network, the area of\\nmultidisciplinary research
      had the highest betweenness centrality.\\nMultidisciplinary research was mostly
      published in scientific journals\\nsuch as [PLoS\\nONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/journal-information){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nAccording
      to this journal, they accept: \\\\\\\"[over two hundred subject\\nareas across
      science, engineering, medicine, and the related social\\nsciences and\\nhumanities](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/journal-information){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\\\\\\"\\nTherefore,
      it is quite difficult to dimension multidisciplinary research\\nas a single
      research front, despite its highly strategic position in the\\nresearch fronts
      network. More so, to outline specific recommendations\\nand a plausible course
      of action to follow through the\\nIndustry-University partnership.\_\\n\\n###
      Uncharted research-fronts\\n\\nThrough recognizing research fronts, I could
      determine which\\nresearch-fields had yet to be explored or exploited by\\nindustry-institutions.
      Most of these research-fields were from health\\nsciences, such as emergency
      medicine, care planning, or optometry,\\nfollowed by fields in the social sciences
      and humanities, such\\ndemography or life-span and life-course studies.\\n\\nHere
      lie plausible interconnections between the aforementioned uncharted\\nfields.
      For instance, [the number of US citizens aged over 65 is\\nprojected to double
      by\\n2060](https://www.prb.org/resources/fact-sheet-aging-in-the-united-states/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nIs
      it a tangible research front plausibly formed by care planning and\\ndemography?
      Is it a potential research front for industry-research\\ninstitutions in Latin
      America and the Caribbean?\\n\\nWhat I have discussed here could be of great
      use to industry and\\nresearch institutions. As a first insight, both parties
      can identify\\nmature and emergent research fronts and assess how strategic
      their\\nresearch capacities are amid the bibliographic network structure.\\nSecond,
      they can identify research fields clustered nearby and gauge how\\nlikely or
      attractive it might be to delve into different fields.\\nFinally, parties can
      see more clearly which research fields are still\\nunexplored by joint efforts
      between research institutions and industry.\\nFurther studies could also source
      other types of research institutions\\nand industry knowledge outputs such as
      patents and patent-citation data\\nto expand industry and research institution
      endeavors.  \\n\\n[  \\nHeader image:\_Laurel and Michael Evans on\\n[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/mfq1Bml-ITY?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}[](https://unsplash.com/photos/D_YZmKGSyic?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}]{.caption}\\n\",\"published_at\":1681374600,\"updated_at\":1708703227,\"indexed_at\":1708118022,\"authors\":[{\"name\":

      La nueva posici\xF3n es usada como una muestra irrefutable de la\\nexcelencia

      Nobel que una universidad que se\\nestableci\xF3 hace 40 a\xF1os. A pesar de
      ello, los listados jer\xE1rquicos de\\nlas \\\"mejores universidades del mundo\\\"
      siguen siendo publicados y usados\\nampliamente, especialmente por las propias
      universidades y los medios de\\ncomunicaci\xF3n.\\n\\n### El Leiden Ranking\\n\\nEl
      Leiden Ranking no es un listado jer\xE1rquico ni est\xE1tico, sino que\\nprovee
      indicadores cubriendo varias dimensiones del desempe\xF1o de 1411\\nuniversidades
      mundiales a partir de datos bibliom\xE9tricos, es decir a\\npartir de publicaciones
      cient\xEDficas. Las universidades que se han\\nincluido en la \xFAltima edici\xF3n,
      2023, son aquellas que tienen un m\xEDnimo\\nde 800 publicaciones contadas de
      forma fraccional e indexadas en la Web\\nof Science (WoS).\\n\\nEl ranking es
      publicado por el [Center for Science and Technologies\\nStudies (CWTS)](http://www.cwts.nl){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      un centro de la\\nUniversidad de Leiden en los Pa\xEDses Bajos, y se gu\xEDa

      primera vista, el Leiden Ranking parece un ranking como cualquier otro\\ndado
      que al abrir la p\xE1gina encontramos un listado de universidades\\nordenado
      de acuerdo a cierto criterio de impacto cient\xEDfico: por defecto\\nel n\xFAmero
      de publicaciones (P) calculadas siguiendo el recuento\\nfraccionario. Sin embargo,
      este no es un ordenamiento jer\xE1rquico\\nest\xE1tico de universidades ya que
      de forma interactiva podemos ordenar el\\nlistado bas\xE1ndonos en la dimensi\xF3n
      e indicador que estemos interesados,\\nde entre las diferentes opciones que
      se ofrecen. De hecho, el ranking no\\nes un listado sino una herramienta que
      permite explorar los indicadores\\ndesde varias perspectivas. Adem\xE1s, el
      listado inicial que aparece es una\\nde las tres perspectivas que ofrece el
      sitio para explorar diferentes\\ndimensiones e indicadores, las otras dos son
      por mapa o por gr\xE1fico.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/LR2023_Spanish_2_3.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"34734\\\"

      Diferentes dimensiones e indicadores\\n\\nA diferencia de otros rankings, el
      Leiden Ranking s\xF3lo provee\\ninformaci\xF3n sobre los resultados de la investigaci\xF3n
      cient\xEDfica a partir\\nde publicaciones en revistas indexadas por la WoS.
      Este enfoque nos\\npermite garantizar que los datos hayan sido recolectados
      y enriquecidos\\ncon rigor, y que la metodolog\xEDa usada para el an\xE1lisis
      sea transparente.\\n\\nLas diferentes dimensiones que se pueden explorar son:\\n\\n-
      Impacto cient\xEDfico -- basada en citas a las publicaciones de una\\n  universidad.\\n-
      Colaboraci\xF3n -- basada en la colaboraci\xF3n de una universidad con otras\\n
      \ organizaciones y regiones.\\n- Acceso Abierto -- basada en las publicaciones
      en acceso abierto de\\n  diferentes tipos.\\n- G\xE9nero -- basada en el an\xE1lisis
      de g\xE9nero de los autores de las\\n  publicaciones.\\n\\nPor su parte, cada
      dimensi\xF3n se puede explorar a trav\xE9s de diferentes\\nindicadores como
      n\xFAmero total o porcentaje de publicaciones, distancias\\npara la colaboraci\xF3n
      y tipos de Acceso Abierto. En la p\xE1gina de\\n[indicadores](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/indicators){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nse
      encuentra una explicaci\xF3n m\xE1s detallada de cada uno de ellos (en\\ningl\xE9s).\\n\\nAdem\xE1s
      de las dimensiones y sus indicadores, el usuario puede crear su\\npropio ranking
      seleccionando un periodo, disciplina, regi\xF3n y n\xFAmero\\nm\xEDnimo de publicaciones.
      Por \xFAltimo, los indicadores de impacto\\ncient\xEDfico se pueden calcular
      utilizando un m\xE9todo de recuento total o\\nfraccionario. El m\xE9todo de
      recuento completo otorga un peso total de 1 a\\ncada publicaci\xF3n de una universidad.
      El m\xE9todo de recuento fraccionado\\nda menos peso a las publicaciones colaborativas
      que a las no\\ncolaborativas.\\n\\n**La Universidad de S\xE3o Paulo y la Universidad
      Nacional Aut\xF3noma de\\nM\xE9xico**\\n\\nEn la edici\xF3n del 2023 encontramos
      a la Universidad de S\xE3o Paulo (USP) y\\na la Universidad Nacional Aut\xF3noma
      de M\xE9xico (UNAM), entre muchas otras\\nde Am\xE9rica Latina. Al ver la vista
      est\xE1ndar en el listado parece que USP\\nest\xE1 en 86 posiciones m\xE1s arriba
      que la UNAM. Si nos fijamos en las\\nopciones veremos que se trata del periodo
      2018-2021, para todas las\\ndisciplinas, en todo el mundo, con un m\xEDnimo
      de publicaciones en 100,\\ndimensi\xF3n impacto cient\xEDfico, ordenado por

      consistently emphasised the\\nimportance of [responsible use of university\\nrankings](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/responsibleuse){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      \ \\n\\nToday the Leiden Ranking takes a next step in promoting responsible
      ways\\nof dealing with university rankings. By partnering with the [INORMS More\\nThan
      Our Rank\\ninitiative](https://inorms.net/more-than-our-rank/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nthe
      Leiden Ranking highlights that, notwithstanding any value that\\nrankings may
      have, institutions are so much more than their rank.  \\n\\nThe More Than Our
      Rank initiative was launched in October 2022 to\\nprovide all universities,
      whether top ten or yet to place, with an\\nopportunity to show how much more
      they have to offer the world than is\\ncaptured in the global university rankings.
      Signatories simply add the\\nMore Than Our Rank logo to their website and provide
      a statement\\nshowcasing their activities, achievements and ambitions. A small,
      but\\ngrowing, number of pioneering universities have become early\\nsignatories,
      supported by a wide range of international university\\nassociations, ranking
      providers and responsible research assessment\\ngroups, including the Leiden
      Ranking.  \\n\\nAs of today, the Leiden Ranking has taken its commitment to
      More Than\\nOur Rank one step further: All More Than Our Rank signatories that\\nappear
      in the Leiden Ranking are highlighted on the ranking website by\\npresenting
      the More Than Our Rank logo next to their institution name\\n(see the screenshots
      below). Visitors to the website will be able to\\nclick on the link on each
      institution's profile to visit the More Than\\nOur Rank website and view an
      institution's More Than Our Rank\\nstatement.  \\n\\nParticipating in the More
      Than Our Rank initiative is a risk-free way\\nfor institutions to emphasise
      their strengths not captured by global\\nrankings. By highlighting a university's
      More Than Our Rank endorsement\\non the Leiden Ranking website, we aim to provide
      further encouragement\\nfor institutions to join More Than Our Rank.  \\n\\nThe
      CWTS Leiden Ranking and INORMS More Than Our Rank initiative are\\nthrilled
      to be partnering in this way. We hope that many more\\ninstitutions will be

      my answer to\\nthis question would be: yes and no.\\n\\nLet me start with the
      latter.\\n\\nNo, the last thing contemporary science needs are heroes. What
      it does\\nneed is structural reform. Science suffers from major flaws, including\\nvarious
      forms of bias, structural inequality, lack of transparency and\\nrigor, excessive
      competition, commercialization, and vanity publishing.\\nIt is unhealthy for
      researchers to want to be a hero in the current\\nsystem.\\n\\nBut also: yes!
      Science is in dire need of heroes! Because the science\\nsystem needs to reform,
      we need different types of people who can lead\\nthe way and set an example
      with good leadership. This is what I want to\\naddress in this commentary.\\n\\n<figure

      Boerhaave\\\\'s wonderful collection, I\\nwill go back to the 19^th^ century,
      when the first university ranking\\nwas conceived. People often think the first
      ranking appeared around the\\n2000s, with the publication of the first commercial
      ranking. But that is\\nnot true. As is more often the case, problematic metrics
      for assessing\\nexcellence are in fact invented by scientists themselves!\\n\\nA
      few years ago, I examined the work of the American psychologist James\\nMcKeen
      Cattell [with two of my\\ncolleagues](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11024-017-9329-x.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nCattell
      lived from 1860 to 1944, served as the long-time editor of the\\njournal *Science*,
      and his primary academic interest was the study of\\n\\\\'eminence\\\\', a somewhat
      ambiguous concept that I translate here as\\nexcellence, eminence, or greatness.
      There is an interesting connection\\nbetween Cattell\\\\'s work on \\\\'eminence\\\\'
      as the primary \\\\'virtue\\\\' of\\nindividual researchers and the contemporary
      university rankings of the\\nmost prestigious, high-performing, Nobel Prize-winning
      universities with\\nthe most flourishing research and best teaching environments.\\n\\nCattell
      studied in England and later held an office in Cambridge, where\\nhe eventually
      came into contact with proponents of eugenics. Cattell,\\nand many other contemporaries
      interested in \\\\'eminence\\\\' or greatness,\\nobserved a decrease in the
      number of \\\\'great men\\\\' compared to earlier\\nperiods, which they found
      concerning. They feared the biological\\ndegeneration of the population, and
      this fear was exacerbated by a more\\ngeneral concern about the decline of the
      British Empire. This fear was\\nfurther intensified by the rise of industrialization,
      democratization,\\nand a growing working class. The preoccupation with \\\\'great
      men\\\\' was\\nalso reflected in a growing interest in the role of the scientist
      in a\\ntime when scientific work increasingly became a \\\\'profession\\\\'
      among\\nother professions. The scientific method of eugenics gave Cattell the\\ntools
      to classify \\\\'eminence\\\\' in a new way. His idea was that\\nprofessors
      could be placed on a single ranked list based on peer review.\\nHe asked a large
      number of scientists to create a list, ranking\\nscientists from the most to
      the least prominent, based on a selection of\\nnames provided in advance. High
      \\\\\\\"output\\\\\\\" was insufficient as an\\nindicator of \\\\'eminence\\\\';
      it was primarily about reputation among\\npeers. What exactly this reputation
      was based on remained ambiguous.\\nCattell kept various background and biographical
      information about the\\nmen on the lists, including data on birthplace, residence,
      age, and\\nespecially the university where researchers had received their\\neducation.
      But his lists also quickly started to serve other purposes:\\nhe mapped how
      \\\\'scientific eminence\\\\' was distributed across cities and\\nuniversities.
      And I quote from a piece in 1903: \\\\\\\"We can tell whether\\nthe average
      scientific standard in one part of the country or at a\\ncertain university
      is higher or lower than elsewhere; we can also\\nquantitatively map the scientific
      strength of a university or\\ndepartment.\\\\\\\" So, initially, Cattell\\\\'s
      lists were not compiled with the\\npurpose of comparing institutions, but the
      information these instruments\\nprovided was indeed used for these comparisons.\\n\\n<figure

      year</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n  \\n\\nCattell\\\\'s study of scientific
      men and his subsequent ranking of\\nuniversities was deeply rooted in a larger
      debate about the role of the\\nscientist. The ideal image of a researcher was
      evolving significantly at\\nthe end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th
      century, as I think is\\nhappening again today. But back then, older ideas about
      the\\ngentleman-scholar, driven by intrinsic motivation, were increasingly\\njuxtaposed
      with ideals that were more in line with the concept of\\nscience as a paid profession.
      Just as the current preoccupation with\\nexcellence and ranking is related to
      a much broader discussion about\\nwhat universities are exactly for today!\\n\\nOver
      the past 30+ years the Dutch and European governments have\\nintroduced several
      different policy instruments to foster excellent\\nresearch. These policy instruments
      worked by stimulating competition in\\nscience, and what I find very interesting
      is how these research policy\\ninstruments have in the past decades started
      to shape our perception of\\nexcellent science through an interactive feedback
      loop between policy on\\nthe one hand and the practice of doing research on
      the other. An\\nexcellent researcher's standing is now primarily determined
      by their\\nresearch production. This is partly still science as a profession
      that\\nCattell and others instigated, but this profession is now saturated with\\nkey
      performance indicators (like a lot of other professions in\\nneoliberal democratic
      societies). The primary tactical and strategic\\naims have become competing
      for (ever decreasing amounts of) research\\nincome, and publishing in prestigious
      journals, and aiming for a Nobel\\nPrize. Put even stronger, prizes and awards
      have become important parts\\nof academic CVs. And because of gender and other
      diversity gaps, this\\nmakes it harder for women and other minority groups to
      make a career in\\nscience. University rankings use prizes and awards as input,
      and this\\ntrickles down in university policies. Universities over the past
      decades\\nhave started to think in terms of globalised economic markets for\\nexcellent
      researchers.\\n\\nThe motivation behind policies for excellence perhaps at one
      point made\\nsense, and Dutch science is doing well by the numbers, but obviously,\\nand
      this is not often acknowledged, there is a big structural issue with\\nthe way
      we measure excellence. If we are truly honest: current notions\\nof excellence
      and metrics-driven assessment criteria are threatening to\\nshape the content
      of the work and the diversity of the subject matter.\\nWe are observing that
      research is designed and adjusted in a way that\\nensures a good score. We see
      that people are choosing research questions\\nnot just based on interest or
      importance, but also to improve their\\nchances of getting a job. This ['thinking
      with\\nindicators'](https://academic.oup.com/rev/article/26/3/157/3933574){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nis
      obviously problematic for science when important research questions\\nare not
      being addressed and even become 'unthinkable'.\\n\\nThis type of thinking also
      has consequences for the space in academia\\nfor what you could call 'social'
      elements. Think of decreasing\\ncollegiality, less commitment to the community,
      or bad leadership. And\\nif we\\\\'re mostly noticing and applauding the \\\\'big
      names,\\\\' those\\nveteran academics with a significant reputation, we are
      hurting the\\nopportunities for talented newcomers and other team members who
      play\\ncrucial roles. What worries me is that the pressure in many places is
      so\\nhigh that ambitious young researchers think they cannot go on holiday\\nbecause
      otherwise their work will be 'scooped'. Competitiveness can\\ncreate feelings
      of constant failure among early career researchers, as\\nthey may never feel
      they meet the required standards. And even those who\\nare at the top, and we
      have interviewed many, often feel they must\\ncontinue to work ever harder to
      keep out-competing others. Group leaders\\nand heads of department warn each
      other about the health risks that they\\nrun by chronically working very hard,
      year after year. This is an actual\\nquote from an actual interview:  \\n\\nThe
      example these senior researchers are setting with that behaviour to\\ntheir
      younger colleagues is that it is heroic to work eighty hours a\\nweek, and that
      if people can't keep up, they are not fit for the\\nChampions League. These
      senior researchers have really internalised that\\nthis is what it takes to
      play the game, and that if you can't stand the\\nheat, you should get out of
      the kitchen. But let's face it, that kitchen\\nis on fire.\\n\\nFor one, we
      have globally had several severe integrity and\\nreproducibility crises. We
      have seen the shadow side of competition,\\nwhere researchers focus too much
      on finding new things and trying to do\\nthat quickly, even if that means that
      they might not be doing\\nhigh-quality research. Of course, we all want to tell
      our students to\\ndream big and ideally, we also provide them with the protected
      space to\\ndevelop their own research and strive for the highest quality. However,\\nif
      in the meantime we also encourage them to focus on chasing after\\ngroundbreaking
      results and judge success mainly by how many times our\\nwork gets cited by
      others, we create a culture where short-termism and\\nrisk aversion thrive.
      This culture is today also driven by a pressure to\\nsecure funding in competitive
      four-year cycles. This, in turn, makes it\\nvery hard for researchers to do
      long-term, risky projects, or work in\\nfields that have a big impact on society
      but don\\\\'t get cited as much,\\nlike applied sciences or social sciences.
      As a result, research agendas\\ndon\\\\'t always focus on what society really
      needs. Also, all this\\ncompetition can make scientists less likely to collaborate,
      which is\\ncrucial for solving complex problems.\\n\\nTo make science better,
      we need to change our priorities, and support a\\nwider range of research. We
      very urgently need more diverse perspectives\\nand inclusive participation in
      science. [We need to collaborate and open\\nup,](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/08/14/the-benefits-of-open-science-are-not-inevitable-monitoring-its-development-should-be-value-led/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nsimply
      because what is expected of science today greatly exceeds the\\nproblem-solving
      capacity of science alone. And that is why we also\\nreally need to rethink
      the criteria for excellent research. These\\ncriteria need to be more inclusive,
      because research evaluation has the\\npower to affect the culture of research;
      individual career trajectories\\nand researchers' well-being; the quality of
      evidence informing policy\\nmaking; and importantly, the priorities in research
      and research\\nfunding.\\n\\nI would also like to address a misunderstanding
      about the Dutch\\n['recognition and rewards'\\nprogram](https://recognitionrewards.nl/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      I often hear\\na concern that the program wants to wishy-washily include everyone
      and\\nforgets about upholding excellence. I do not think that this is a fair\\nportrayal
      of the program. At its core, the program is about an honest\\nlook in the mirror,
      and about fixing what is broken. The program is part\\nof a much larger set
      of national, regional, and global initiatives\\nincluding the [DORA Declaration](https://sfdora.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand

      these initiatives are part of a global effort to re-think\\nevaluation. And
      we need other types of leaders and heroes in academia,\\nwho will work together
      to implement responsible forms of research\\nassessment. We should stop sending
      each other the message that\\nregardless of how hard we all work, there is always
      more we need to do\\nto succeed. If we want our work to be meaningful, we need
      to invest more\\nin building strong academic communities that value collaboration
      and\\nshare a commitment to advancing research and teaching, while making a\\npositive
      impact on and with society.\\n\\nOne of my heroes in life is Pippi Langstr\xF6m,
      or Pippie Langkous in\\nDutch. I used to watch her show when I was little. Pippi
      has this\\nsaying: \\\"I have never tried this before, so I think I should definitely\\nbe
      able to do that.\\\" I love it. And I believe that we need to reward\\nthis
      type of behaviour more than we currently do in academia, sadly. We\\nshould
      foster taking risks, trying something new, stepping out of our\\ncomfort zone,
      and being bold whilst not taking ourselves too seriously.\\nBut in fact, we
      see the opposite happen among early career researchers.\\nMany of them suffer

      before we can share the outcomes of this process,\\nwe can already provide some
      impressions of the types of ideas we are\\ndiscussing.\\n\\nOn September 15
      and 16, the CWTS team got together in a hotel in Leiden\\nfor a two-day retreat.
      On the first day, we discussed the preliminary\\nplans for our new knowledge
      agenda with a number of external experts,\\nwho offered very useful feedback
      and helped us broaden our horizon. On\\nthe second day, we challenged ourselves
      to think big and to develop\\n'dream projects' that CWTS could work on in the
      coming years. We formed\\nfive groups, each consisting of five or six CWTS colleagues,
      and each\\ngroup spent a few hours developing a dream project.\\n\\n### **Dream
      projects**\\n\\nOne group proposed to set up a *Global Responsible Research
      Assessment\\nSupport Station* (*GRRASS*). The ambition of GRRASS is to bring
      together\\nall stakeholders worldwide interested in making research assessment
      more\\nresponsible. GRRASS would consist of a global network of satellite\\norganizations
      on each continent, each helping to mediate between\\nregional and global level
      activities and issues. Together, these sites\\nwould aim to develop standards
      for responsible research assessment and\\norganize accreditation in which the
      compliance of institutions with\\nthese standards is evaluated.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img
      src=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Picture1.jpg\\\"\\nstyle=\\\"opacity:
      1;\\\" data-image=\\\"29085\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\n  \\n\\nAnother group proposed
      the *New Society-Science Collaboration*. This\\nproposal builds on partnerships
      that CWTS has established in different\\nparts of the world, through existing
      initiatives such as the [SUPER\\nMoRRI project](https://super-morri.eu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      Supported by\\nUnesco, the created network would be used to develop projects
      in a\\nco-creative way, meaning needs-driven, with awareness of diversity and\\nequality
      aspects. That would include partners that are, for instance,\\ngeographically
      diverse, but also originating from all helices of the\\nquadruple helix: academia,
      policy, industry and citizens. The objective\\nis to expand and foster the network
      through activities. In mixed\\nmethods, where the non-digital contexts prevail,
      CWTS could bring in new\\ndigital methods including [diverse data sources and
      advanced mapping\\napproaches](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/cocreating-science-that-society-needs-introducing-the-explore-approach){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Picture2_2022-10-17-164357_twlc.jpg\\\"\\nstyle=\\\"opacity:
      1;\\\" data-image=\\\"29056\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\n  \\n\\nA related idea was
      developed by one of the other groups. This group\\nproposed to set up a *Participatory
      Activists Network*. This network\\nwould focus on helping bring together activists
      who are pushing for\\nchange in the science system but who are not formally
      involved in\\ndecision making in scientific organizations. Contributions by
      CWTS would\\ninitially be situated with specific actors in the network (e.g.,
      around\\nevaluation), but eventually our participation would be present across\\nthe
      network, working closely with a variety of activists.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Picture3.jpg\\\"\\nstyle=\\\"opacity:
      1;\\\" data-image=\\\"29022\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\n  \\n\\nAnother dream project
      aimed to eradicate scientific misinformation from\\nsocietal debates. Using
      a combination of quantitative and qualitative\\nmethods, the project would systematically
      map interactions between\\nscience and society. By making science-society dynamics
      visible and\\ncomprehensible, the project envisions to empower academic and
      societal\\nstakeholders to mitigate misinformation and renew trust in science.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img

      project is the *Open Comprehensive European University\\nResearch Information
      System* (*OCEURIS*), an open CRIS system for all\\nEuropean universities that
      will contain information deemed necessary by\\nmany institutions to realize
      the ambition of making their research\\nassessment processes more responsible.
      The aim is that in the next five\\nyears at least half of the European universities
      will join OCEURIS.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Picture5.jpg\\\"\\nstyle=\\\"opacity:

      of the Year Award**\\n\\nBesides dreaming about future projects, we also used
      the opportunity of\\nbeing together at our retreat to celebrate some of the
      work currently\\nbeing done at our center. Each year an *Employee of the Year
      Award* is\\nhanded out to a CWTS colleague who deserves special recognition.
      This\\nyear the award turned out to be a little bit different than in earlier\\nyears.
      To acknowledge the importance of teamwork at CWTS, Ingeborg\\nMeijer, last year's
      awardee, decided to hand out the award not to an\\nindividual colleague but
      to a team. The award was given to the\\n[A-TEAM](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/a-team-a-stands-for-very-challenging-job){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nwhich
      performs a crucial task at CWTS by performing high-quality\\ncuration of the
      data in our bibliographic database system.\\nCongratulations to all members
      of the team for this well-deserved award.\\nThank you for taking such good care
      of our data!\\n\\n### **What's next**\\n\\nHave we just been dreaming at our
      retreat, or are we actually going to\\nmake our dreams come true? We believe
      the process of developing dream\\nprojects is valuable in itself, even if ultimately
      a project is not\\ngoing to be realized. Developing dream projects stimulated
      us to think\\nin less conventional ways than we normally do and to find out
      what we\\nare truly passionate about. Time will tell whether we will manage
      to\\nfind ways to make our dreams come true. Stay tuned for further updates\\non
      the development of our new knowledge agenda!\\n\\n*We are grateful to our CWTS
      colleagues for sharing their dreams and\\ncontributing to this blog post.*  \\n\",\"published_at\":1666081800,\"updated_at\":1708703227,\"indexed_at\":1708118497,\"authors\":[{\"name\":

      the SDGs by 2030. Out of 220,000 engineering\\narticles indexed by IEEE Xplore
      on AI published from 2000 to 2020, only\\n8% to 30% approximately -depending
      on the engineering discipline-\\ndiscuss issues related to their contribution
      to sustainable development.\\n\\nThose disciplines that discuss sustainable
      development in more than 20%\\nof their production focus on cognitive and cooperative
      systems,\\nprediction methods, decision support systems, and computation theory.\\nOther
      disciplines, such as learning systems, bio-inspired computing, and\\nautonomous
      robots, which are crucial for sustainable development,\\ndiscuss it to a much
      lesser extent (see figure 1).\_\\n\\nWhile it can be argued that entrepreneurs
      and other parties will find\\napplications of these technologies to sustainable
      development, scholars\\nsuch as Yuval Noah-Harari have warned that [what drives
      the development\\nof AI is not an ambition to solve our main societal issues,
      but rather\\nincreasing profits and surveillance of the\\npopulation](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/yuval-noah-harari-sapiens-60-minutes-2021-10-31).\\nWe
      contend, then, that at a time of planetary crisis we need more\\nawareness and
      commitment of engineers to help envision applications for\\nsolving the major
      challenges of our time. Not engaging in the potential\\nuses of technologies
      poses a risk of a disconnection between AI\\nengineering research and these
      societal issues, leaving the development\\nof these technologies to the forces
      of the market and state control.  \\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/20220906_picture1_2022-09-07-112526_euda.png\\\"\\nalt=\\\"20220906

      means that potential regulations, such as limitations to\\ndata collection,

      infrastructure to reproduce research results and\\ntechnologies, and a lack
      of local expertise to audit them.  \\n\\nA hopeful finding in our article is
      that sustainable development is\\nincreasingly being discussed in certain AI-related

      and *Education*. Specifically on AI subjects, we found\\nemerging discussions
      of sustainable development in *Recurrent neural\\nNetworks*, *Prediction Methods*,
      *Computation Theory*, *Learning\\nSystems*, and *Machine learning*. We believe
      building on these emerging\\ninterests can help to educate engineers that are
      more concerned with\\ntheir natural and social environment.\_\\n\\nHowever,
      to foster the relevance of AI research for sustainable\\ndevelopment, capabilities
      need to be built in those countries that have\\ntraditionally been marginalized.
      A decisive and generous approach to\\ninternational collaboration and knowledge

      the first (pilot) global monitoring exercise on the progress of OS\\naccording
      to this value-led perspective.\\n\\n[*(Note that the UNESCO OS Outlook will
      be introduced by Dr. Tiffany\\nStraza in a\_CWTS webinar [on 2^nd^ February,
      2024, 15:00-16.15\\nCET](https://www.cwts.nl/seminars/announcements?article=n-t2q234&title=status-and-trends-in-open-science-open-to-what-and-for-whom-the-unesco-os-outlook){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).*]{.caption}[]{.caption}\\n\\nThe
      good news is that there is a strong trend towards\\\"open\\\" (i.e.\\naccessible)
      scientific outputs: the share of Open Access (OA)\\npublications is quickly
      increasing; the Outlook shows evidence of more\\nsharing of datasets, software
      and educational resources; and an increase\\nin participatory approaches to
      science.\\n\\nThere are, however, two downsides to this growth. First, OS has\\nprogressed
      faster in rich countries and organisations. This is no\\nsurprise: the transition
      towards OS requires significant financial and\\nhuman resources; therefore wealthy
      countries and organisations are in an\\nadvantageous position to adopt OS.\\n\\nHowever,
      this inequality also reflects choices made regarding the types\\nof OS to develop.
      For example, as shown in Figure 2, OA has mainly grown\\nvia the adoption of
      gold and hybrid OA models (with substantial costs\\nfor organisations), although
      diamond and green OA provide more\\naffordable and more equitable alternatives.
      Given differences in\\nresources and distinct publishing traditions, OA in Western
      countries\\nhas advanced via gold and hybrid models, whereas regions such as
      Eastern\\nEurope and Latin America have kept a substantial share of diamond
      OA (as\\nshown in Figure 3). In short, the expansion of gold and hybrid models
      of\\nOA has led to territorial inequality in the visibility and prestige of\\npublications.\\n\\n<figure

      Open Science Outlook</a>.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe second gap
      found by the UNESCO OS Outlook is that monitoring efforts\\nhave mainly focused
      on scientific outputs (primarily in scientific\\npublications, and secondly\_on
      datasets, software and hardware), but much\\nless on OS processes, outcomes
      or values. This means that there are too\\nfew monitoring efforts on axes of
      open science such as the use of\\ncollective infrastructures, participatory
      activities or dialogues with\\nother knowledge systems; and little empirical
      evidence on the alignment\\nof OS progress with values and principles.\\n\\nThe
      dangers of this uneven monitoring (a focus on outputs but not on\\nprocesses
      and values) is the so-called ['streetlight\\neffect'](https://bid.ub.edu/en/40/molas.htm){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}:
      that\\npolicy attention focuses on those activities that can be monitored,\\n[leaving

      conduct open science in ways that are not visible to traditional\\nscientific
      indicators. Such bias is particularly problematic because OS\\nas dialogue and
      participation is key to help [aligning research with\\nsocietal problems and\\nchallenges](https://steps-centre.org/blog/to-meet-the-sustainable-development-goals-we-must-transform-innovation/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\n###
      **Opening up the monitoring of Open Science: more activities, more voices**\\n\\nIn
      summary, the UNESCO OS Outlook highlights that OS is making progress,\\nbut
      that this progress is uneven in two senses: it is concentrated in\\nthe rich
      organisations and countries, and it appears to be focused\\n(according to current
      monitoring tools) more on the internal scientific\\noutputs than on knowledge
      creation and exchange with societal\\nstakeholders.\\n\\nThese findings deserve
      some reflection in relation to current OS\\npolicies.\\n\\nIn terms of monitoring,
      new [frameworks are\\nneeded](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/08/14/the-benefits-of-open-science-are-not-inevitable-monitoring-its-development-should-be-value-led/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nthat
      are more comprehensive, more pluralistic and which include value\\nconsiderations.
      In particular, [we have proposed that approaches to\\nassess OS](https://osf.io/4vgq5){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      should aim to address\\nall aspects and values of OS: first, broadening out
      the battery of OS\\nactivities captured (from outputs/papers to processes/engagements);\\nsecond,
      opening up the monitoring to consider the diversity of possible\\nOS trajectories
      (which directions align with stated values? gold or\\ngreen? FAIR or CARE datasets?);
      third [contextualising the description\\nof\\nOS](https://idrc-crdi.ca/en/book/contextualizing-openness-situating-open-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n(e.g.
      high energy physics in Tokyo and applied agriculture in rural\\nIndia require
      different types of OS).\\n\\nIn terms of inequalities, an explicit monitoring
      on inclusiveness and\\ncollective benefits is crucial, because science has historically\\nexcluded
      some social groups (e.g. women and non-Westerners), as argued\\nby scholars
      such as [Sandra\\nHarding](https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/book/1983/Sciences-from-BelowFeminisms-Postcolonialities-and){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nAlso,

      How agriculture benefits from research through extension and engagement\\n\\nDifferent
      sectors benefit from science in different ways. In the case of\\nagriculture,

      farmers, for example in the form of seeds or machinery. However, the\\ndiffusion
      or uptake of innovations is difficult, in particular for small\\nfarmers. For
      this reason, the dissemination of agricultural research\\nthrough initiatives
      like 'extension' programs has long been recognized\\nas essential for development.\\n\\nThese
      extension activities to reach out to small farmers are\\nparticularly important
      in relation to improving livelihoods. In 2020,\\n[720-811 million were suffering
      from\\nhunger](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nworldwide,
      of which 50% were estimated to be small farmers. This means\\nthat improving
      food security requires forms of research transfer and\\nlocal and indigenous
      knowledge integration that reach out to small\\nfarmers, who constitute a particularly
      vulnerable group.\\n\\nPublic organisations working on agriculture have long
      been aware of the\\ncentrality of 'extension' for improving rural livelihoods.
      The reason is\\nthat agriculture depends heavily on contexts, and agricultural
      contexts\\nmay change dramatically across short geographical distances due to\\nvariations
      in climate and soils. The notion of 'extension' research\\ngradually shifted
      from top-down, unidirectional teaching from\\nresearchers to farmers, toward
      more mutual learning and co-operation\\nbetween researchers and farmers, so
      that science can respond to these\\nlocal needs and contexts. Through [participatory
      and learning\\napproaches](https://www.participatorymethods.org/page/about-participatory-methods){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\ncan
      technical and local knowledge be combined in order to achieve\\nappropriate
      technologies.\\n\\n### The lower visibility of engaged scholarship in agriculture
      may lead to use of inappropriate technology\\n\\nHowever, research that is more
      engaged with users and more orientated\\ntowards application tends to be associated
      with lower academic\\nvisibility, because its publications are often not included
      in the\\nmainstream bibliographic databases.\\n\\n[Various\\nstudies](https://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/66409/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nhave
      shown that coverage of journals of agricultural sciences in\\nmainstream databases
      is lower than in the natural sciences, but well\\nabove the social sciences
      and the humanities. Yet the situation is much\\nworse in terms of the coverage
      of the Global South in the mainstream\\ndatabases. For example, [studies by
      Subbiah\\nArunachalam](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/24106511.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      2001 showed that of the 10,000 publications by Indian researchers in\\nagricultural
      research, 78% were in Indian journals and 77% were not\\nindexed by Web of Science.
      Other studies have highlighted that crops\\nrelevant in the Global South also
      have a much lower coverage in Web of\\nScience (WoS), for example [the crop
      pearl\\nmillet](http://oar.icrisat.org/7945/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\n[A
      study on rice\\nresearch](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3kf9d/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nfound
      that coverage of publications in mainstream databases was 2 to\\n3-fold higher
      for the Global North. Similarly, the coverage of topics\\nrelevant to the Global
      North in WoS and Scopus was 2-3-fold higher than\\nthe topics more relevant
      in the Global South -- as illustrated in Figure\\n1 for the case of rice research.\\n\\nGiven
      that the mission of agricultural research institutes and councils\\nis to increase
      food security, reduce poverty and improve natural\\necosystems, knowledge communicated
      through a plurality of channels\\nshould be valued beyond mainstream international
      journals. This would\\ninclude, for example, publication formats such as those
      collected by FAO\\nin its [AGRIS database](https://agris.fao.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      (based\\non national collection and analysis centres), which include coverage
      of\\nmore diverse document types (reports, policy briefs, etc.) in comparison\\nto
      citation index databases such as WoS or to abstracting and indexing\\ndatabases
      such as CAB Abstracts.\\n\\nThis lack of visibility has at least two downsides.
      First, universities\\nor research institutes conducting extension programmes
      or engaged\\nagricultural research have often come to be perceived as not doing\\nprestigious
      science -- as excellence has increasingly been defined\\naccording to publications
      in prestigious journals. As a result,\\nresearchers may feel motivated to study
      topics valued by 'top' journals,\\nwhich are mostly focused on topics in the
      Global North.\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"image-full landscape\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Rafols_Figure1.png\\\"

      without being indexed in databases and without good Academic\\nSearch Engine
      Optimization for Open Access content, valuable contextual\\nknowledge is harder
      to discover, making it challenging to retrieve or\\naccess it. In consequence,
      technical experts in agriculture in the\\nGlobal South are more likely to apply
      technologies which are\\ninappropriate in their countries. For instance, the
      crop varieties that\\nare available in WoS may not correspond to relevant varieties
      for a\\ntropical context, and information about the crops may be appropriate
      for\\nEurope but inappropriate in Brazil or India. Including more local\\nagricultural

      due to the lower amount of\\nresearch in topics and areas of interest of the

      coverage of agriculture in bibliographic databases\\n\\nA [new\\npublication](https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/doi/10.1162/qss_a_00228/114119/Recalibrating-the-Scope-of-Scholarly-Publishing-A){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nby
      the [Public Knowledge Project](https://pkp.sfu.ca/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\ninterestingly
      challenges the perception, created by the conventional use\\nof mainstream databases,
      that research is extremely concentrated in\\njournals and publications of the
      Global North. Analysing 25,671 journals\\nwith 5.8 million documents of the
      platform Open Journal System (OJS),\\nthey found that 80% of the publications
      originated in the Global South,\\nthat 85% are in diamond Open Access (no fee
      for authors nor readers) and\\nalmost half of them have more than one language.\\n\\nThe
      success of the OJS infrastructure in making possible access and\\nvisibility
      of knowledge from the Global South suggests that it is high\\ntime for the development
      of more comprehensive databases. This has been\\na concern in medical research
      and social science and humanities (SSH),\\nleading to the development of regional
      specialised databases such as\\n[Scielo](https://scielo.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      (more on health) and\\n[Redalyc](https://www.redalyc.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      (more on SSH). In\\nrecent years we have also witnessed the development of more\\ncomprehensive
      databases like [Open\\nAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\n[Dimensions](https://www.dimensions.ai/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      or\\n[Lens](https://www.lens.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nWe have conducted
      a small study using the [MIAR portal of the\\n'Information Matrix for the Analysis
      of\\nJournals'](https://miar.ub.edu/idioma/en){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} of the\\nUniversity
      of Barcelona in order to make a rough estimate of the journal\\ncoverage of
      various databases (see detailed\\n[methodology](https://osf.io/fd9cv){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      and [journal\\ndata](https://osf.io/9hdgc){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}). As shown
      in Figure 3,\\nfrom a sample of 1662 journals from any country with ISSN related
      to\\nagriculture, we found that CAB Abstracts had the highest coverage with\\n805
      (48%) journals, 562 (34%) of Scopus, 435 (26%) of WoS and 550 (33%)\\nof Veterinary
      Sciences. In terms of regional coverage, CAB Abstracts and\\nVeterinary Sciences
      have a better and broader coverage in the Global\\nSouth in relative terms.\\n\\n<figure

      journals by the largest database specialised in\\nagriculture, CAB Abstracts,
      in comparison to WoS and Scopus. 46% of the\\njournals are not covered by any
      of these databases.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nThese results have to be contrasted
      with new databases such as\\n*Dimensions* and *Open Alex* that index papers
      rather than journals.\\nHere we have made some estimations for *Dimensions*,
      which showed a\\ncoverage of about 1160 (70%) of journals. The coverage was
      high also in\\nthe Global South, with 46 (41%) of African journals, against
      a 28 (25%)\\nin CAB Abstracts. Only for a few countries, including Iran, Germany,\\nRomania
      or Cuba, was *Dimensions* coverage lower than *CAB Abstracts*.  \\n\\nThe downside
      of these new, more comprehensive databases (alongside with\\nthe Google Scholar
      Coverage) is the lack of inquiry of the publishing\\npractices of journals.
      We found that some of the journals included in\\nthe larger databases, but not
      present in the more traditional databases\\nsuch as CAB Abstracts, have a higher
      incidence of problematic or\\nquestionable editorial and review practices (here
      the term ['predatory'\\nis\\nunhelpful](https://www-ub-edu.translate.goog/blokdebid/es/content/ineficiencias-defectos-y-practicas-fraudulentas-en-la-comunicacion-cientifica-abriendo-el?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=es-419&_x_tr_pto=wapp){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\n\\n###
      Another bibliographic coverage is possible, and necessary\\n\\nIn conclusion,
      another bibliographic world is possible where knowledge\\nis more diverse and
      accessible -- and this is important for agricultural\\nresearch to be more visible
      and accessible in and from the Global South.\\nInfrastructures towards this
      transformation have to be developed to\\nenhance interoperability and cooperation.
      This is the case, for example,\\nof the analysis centres that feed the FAO\\\\'s
      [AGRIS information\\nsystem](https://agris.fao.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      including grey\\nliterature. While currently no single commercial bibliographic
      database\\nhas a good coverage of agriculture, a new generation of databases
      in\\nconjunction with metadata aggregators from open access repositories may\\nhelp
      fill this gap. This increase in diversity of journals comes at the\\ncost of
      having a larger greyscale of rigour in journal editorial\\npractices. This challenge
      could be overcome with catalogues of editorial\\npractices such as [DOAJ](https://doaj.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      or\\n[Latindex](https://latindex.org/latindex/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} and\\nplatforms
      such as [MIAR](https://miar.ub.edu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nIt is about
      time to create more comprehensive open infrastructures to\\nprovide visibility
      and accessibility of agricultural knowledge relevant\\nto many more contexts,
      particularly in the Global South, so that\\nknowledge of appropriate technologies
      can foster human development\\nacross all the world.\\n\\n**Acknowledgement:**

      the first experts expressing concerns about the [fatal\\nattraction of rankings
      of\\nuniversities](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-005-0008-6){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nBy
      creating the Leiden Ranking and contributing to\\n[U-Multirank](https://www.umultirank.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      we have\\nintroduced alternatives to simplistic one-dimensional rankings. We
      have\\nalso developed [ten\\nprinciples](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/responsibleuse){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nto
      guide the responsible use of university rankings.\\n\\nBuilding on this longstanding

      the Leiden Ranking offers methodological transparency by\\n[documenting its\\nmethods](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/general){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin

      on\\nwhich the ranking is based (made available to us by Clarivate, the owner\\nof

      limits the [transparency and\\nreproducibility](https://arma.ac.uk/rethinking-the-rankings/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nof
      the Leiden Ranking. It is also in tension with the growing\\nrecognition of
      the importance of \\\"independence and transparency of the\\ndata, infrastructure
      and criteria necessary for research assessment and\\nfor determining research
      impacts\\\" (one of the principles of the\\n[Agreement on Reforming Research\\nAssessment](https://coara.eu/app/uploads/2022/09/2022_07_19_rra_agreement_final.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\n\\nIn
      the [new strategic plan of\\nCWTS](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-focal-areas-of-cwts){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nopenness
      of research information is a top priority. Open data sources\\nsuch as [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      and\\n[OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} offer exciting\\nopportunities

      years ago, [Dietmar Wolfram and\\ncolleagues](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-020-03488-4){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nrevealed
      a strong growth in recent years in the number of journals\\nsupporting some
      form of open peer review. Over 600 journals offered open\\npeer review in 2019.
      These journals published the reports of reviewers,\\nthe identities of reviewers,
      or both.  \\n\\nFigure 1 shows a similar growth in the number of peer review
      records in\\nCrossref that are linked to a journal article. This number increased\\nfrom
      fewer than 10,000 in 2018 to more than 60,000 in 2020 and 2021.\\nEach of these
      peer review records represents a review report of a\\nreviewer, a decision letter
      of an editor, or a response letter of an\\nauthor. Many journal articles\_are
      linked to multiple peer review records\\nin Crossref. In 2021, over 13,000 journal
      articles had a link to one or\\nmore peer review records.  \\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/the-growth-of-open-peer-review-image-1.png\\\"\\nstyle=\\\"opacity:

      \ \\nAs shown in Figure 2,\\n[Publons](https://publons.com/benefits/publishers/transparent-review){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nis
      by far the largest contributor of peer review records in Crossref,\\naccounting
      for two-third of all records. A large majority of these\\nrecords are linked
      to journal articles published by Wiley. Indeed, Wiley\\nhas made a [considerable\\neffort](https://doi.org/10.22541/au.160026642.27642568/v2){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nto
      promote open peer review (referred to as transparent peer review by\\nWiley).
      Other important contributors of peer review records in Crossref\\nare PeerJ
      and eLife.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/the-growth-of-open-peer-review-image-2.png\\\"\\nstyle=\\\"opacity:
      1;\\\" data-image=\\\"24163\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\n[Figure 2. Peer review records
      in Crossref linked to a journal article:\\nBreakdown by platform (left); Breakdown
      by publisher for Publons peer\\nreview records (right).  \\n]{.caption dir=\\\"ltr\\\"}\\n\\n
      \ \\nImportantly, there are several publishers that publish review reports\\nbut
      don't register a Crossref DOI for these reports. This is for\\ninstance the
      case for BMJ, EMBO, MDPI, PLOS, and Springer Nature. There\\nis no straightforward
      way to determine the number of review reports\\npublished by these publishers,
      although some figures can be obtained\\nfrom information provided by the publishers.
      MDPI for instance reports\\nthat in 2020 it published review reports for [over
      34,000\\narticles](https://www.mdpi.com/anniversary25/blog/open-peer-review){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nRecent
      statistics for PLOS show that PLOS published review reports for\\n[more than
      7,500 articles in\\n2021](https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/06/observations-on-published-peer-review-history/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nFor
      Springer Nature recent statistics don't seem to be available, but\\nthe journal
      *Nature* reports to have published review reports [for\\nalmost 450 articles
      in\\n2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-022-00493-w){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nWhile
      precise figures aren't available, it is clear that the total\\nnumber of articles
      in 2021 for which review reports were published\\nwithout a DOI is much larger
      than the 13,000 articles for which review\\nreports were published with a DOI.
      Hence, a large majority of the\\npublished review reports don't have a persistent
      identifier and don't\\nhave openly available metadata. This severely limits
      the value of these\\nreports.  \\n\\nOpen peer review may refer not only to
      publication of review reports,\\nbut also to publication of identities of reviewers.
      The pros and cons of\\ndisclosing reviewer identities have been [discussed\\nextensively](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2021/09/21/open-reviewer-identities-full-steam-ahead-or-proceed-with-caution/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nFor
      peer review records in Crossref classified as review report (instead\\nof decision
      letter or author response), we found that the identity of\\nthe reviewer is
      disclosed in 39% of the cases.  \\n\\n### **Open peer review - Preprints**\\n\\nA
      recent development is the publication of review reports for preprints\\ninstead
      of journal articles. A [variety of platforms and\\ninitiatives](https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/8zj9w)
      offer a range of\\ndifferent approaches to peer review of preprints.\\n\\nFigure
      3 shows the growth in the number of preprint peer review records\\nin Crossref.
      While the number of records is much smaller than for\\njournal articles, the
      growth is impressive, from 20 records in 2019 to\\n733 records in 2021. Three
      platforms,\\n[Qeios](https://www.qeios.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}, [MIT Press
      Rapid\\nReviews\\nCOVID-19](https://rapidreviewscovid19.mitpress.mit.edu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nand
      [ScienceOpen](https://www.scienceopen.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\naccount
      for almost all preprint peer review records in Crossref. A small\\nnumber of
      records originate from [Publons](https://publons.com/), and a\\nfew records
      represent [review reports published by one of\\nus](https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/making-my-peer-review-activity-more-useful){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nusing
      the [PubPub\\nplatform](https://help.pubpub.org/pub/preprints-toolkit/release/4){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/the-growth-of-open-peer-review-image-3.png\\\"\\nstyle=\\\"opacity:
      1;\\\" data-image=\\\"24175\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\n[Figure 3. Peer review records
      in Crossref linked to a preprint: Growth\\nin the number of records (left);
      Breakdown by platform (right).  \\n]{.caption dir=\\\"ltr\\\"}\\n\\nMany review
      reports for preprints don't have a Crossref DOI. These\\nreports aren't included
      in the statistics presented in Figure 3. This is\\nfor instance the case for
      review reports from\\n[PREreview](https://prereview.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      a platform for\\npreprint peer review that uses DOIs from DataCite instead of
      Crossref.\\nPREreview currently contains more than 250 review reports (excluding\\nso-called
      rapid reviews). Other review reports for preprints don't have\\na DOI at all.
      This applies both to review reports published directly on\\na preprint server
      and to review reports published on various preprint\\npeer review platforms.
      The latter reports may be visible in\\n[Sciety](https://sciety.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      a platform that\\naggregates review reports and other evaluations of preprints
      from a\\nvariety of sources.  \\n\\n### **Open peer review - Copernicus and
      F1000**\\n\\nCopernicus and F1000 are special cases. Copernicus offers an [integrated\\nplatform](https://publications.copernicus.org/services/public_peer_review.html){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nthat
      publishes both journal articles and preprints as well as the\\nassociated review
      reports. Likewise, F1000 provides a platform that\\npublishes multiple versions
      of an article, including the review reports\\nfor each version. Because of their
      special nature, we present statistics\\nfor Copernicus and F1000 separately
      from the statistics reported above.\\nPeer review records for Copernicus and
      F1000 aren't included in Figures\\n1, 2, and 3.\\n\\nFigure 4 shows the growth
      in the number of peer review records for\\nCopernicus and F1000. The statistics
      for F1000 were obtained from\\nDataCite instead of Crossref, because F1000 uses
      DataCite to register\\nDOIs for review reports. Copernicus is a major contributor
      of peer\\nreview records in Crossref, especially in earlier years. F1000 is
      a\\npioneer in registering DOIs for review reports, starting in 2012. The\\nnumber
      of peer review records for F1000 is much smaller than for\\nCopernicus, but
      it has shown a steady growth over the past decade.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/the-growth-of-open-peer-review-image-4.png\\\"\\nstyle=\\\"opacity:

      \ {#recommendations}\\n\\nThe statistics presented in this blog post show an
      impressive growth in\\nthe adoption of open peer review, especially in recent
      years.\\nNevertheless, the [transition advocated twenty years ago by Fiona\\nGodlee](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.287.21.2762){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      from\\nthe \\\"flawed system of closed prepublication peer review\\\" to a system
      of\\n\\\"preprint servers combined with open commentary\\\", is still in a very\\nearly
      stage, with preprint peer review starting to take off only very\\nrecently.
      \ \\n\\nWe see improvement of peer review as a joint responsibility of all\\nstakeholders
      involved. Each stakeholder needs to make a contribution. We\\nrecommend that:\\n\\n-
      **Authors and reviewers** explore the interesting new opportunities\\n  offered
      by preprint peer review platforms.\\n\\n- **Scientific publishers and preprint
      peer review platforms**[register\\n  DOIs for open review\\n  reports](https://www.crossref.org/blog/peer-reviews-are-open-for-registering-at-crossref/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n
      \ and include links in the metadata of these reports to the\\n  corresponding
      journal articles and preprints.\\n\\n- **Bibliographic databases** provide data
      not only for journal\\n  articles, but also for preprints and for open review
      reports linked to\\n  journal articles and preprints.\\n\\n- **Research funders
      and institutions** consider using this data in\\n  research assessments in order
      to [give appropriate\\n  recognition](https://www.coalition-s.org/statement-on-peer-reviewed-publications/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n
      \ to the work done by authors and reviewers.\\n\\nWe end this post by drawing
      special attention to an opportunity\\nindividual researchers have to contribute
      to the growth of open peer\\nreview. The [Publish Your Reviews\\ninitiative](http://publishyourreviews.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      launched\\ntoday by [ASAPbio](https://asapbio.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} (and\\nco-organized
      by one of us), calls on researchers to publish their review\\nreports alongside
      the preprint version of an article. This offers an\\neasy way to promote openness
      in peer review. Researchers are invited to\\nexpress their support for the initiative
      by [signing a\\npledge](https://asapbio.org/publishyourreviews#sign){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.

      CVs instead supplement traditional types of biographical\\ninformation with

      about their background/ career/ career\\nmotivation. Ideally, narrative CVs
      can help diversify criteria of\\nsuccess and achievement in research, thereby
      also diversifying the\\nscientific workforce and creating more openness for
      \\\"irregular\\\" career\\ntrajectories.\\n\\nAgainst the backdrop of these
      debates, we organized [a 5-day workshop at\\nthe Lorentz Center in\\nLeiden](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/curricula-vitae-as-reproductive-interfaces-in-research.html){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      December 2022 to bring together different academic stakeholders\\n(including
      researchers, funders, policy makers, and administrators) to\\nreflect on these
      and other new developments in CV territory. In this\\npost we share some of
      our main insights. Urgent short-term goals include\\nthe need for getting a
      better sense of the extent to which narrative CVs\\ncan be effective in addressing
      the above-mentioned issues, and which\\npractical conditions must be met for
      them to achieve their potential. In\\nthe medium- to long run, we should ensure
      that current narrative CV\\nformats are part of a coordinated broader strategy
      to foster inclusive\\npractices in research evaluation.\\n\\n### Historical
      convergence vs a new diversity of CV formats\\n\\nNarrative CV formats can be
      seen as merely the latest development in the\\nevolution of the genre. [Research
      on the morphology of\\nCVs](https://academic.oup.com/rev/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/reseval/rvab040/6500313){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nhas
      for example shown that in the humanities in Germany, a narrative\\nformat has
      been gradually replaced by a tabular format during the second\\nhalf of the
      20th century. More research would be needed to substantiate\\nhow representative
      these findings are for CV practices in other fields\\nand countries. Yet overall,
      we can safely assume that CV formats have\\ntended to converge in recent decades,
      following a relatively universal\\nstructure based on a range of categories
      of achievements.\\n\\nThe standardization of formats is in many ways productive.
      For example,\\nit has made it possible to create overarching digital infrastructures\\nfor
      creating and handling CVs that can also then be reused for specific\\napplication
      purposes. During the workshop, we organized an open source\\ndata mining session
      that drew on the ORCID database, which contains a\\nwealth of biographical profiles
      by researchers that can be used to\\ninterrogate empirical questions about [academic
      career systems and\\nacademic\\ndynamics](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sjck6/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      At\\nthe same time, it is exactly the uniformity of CV formats that current\\nnarrative
      CV initiatives and other critical observers of research\\nevaluation systems
      take issue with, since it exerts a form of\\nnormalizing power on researchers
      that ultimately urges them to develop\\ntheir careers around a rather narrow
      range of categories of\\nachievement.  \\n\\n<figure style=\\\"float:right;
      margin-left:24px;\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/18sarah2-300x300.jpg\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"18292\\\"
      />\\n<figcaption>Visual CV, created by Sarah de Rijcke.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nThe
      narrative CV templates recently introduced by funders and\\nuniversities in
      turn are characterized by a diversity in structure and\\nformat. At the workshop,
      we took a particularly close look at CV formats\\nused by organizations who
      were also represented at our event, which\\nincluded the Luxembourg National
      Research Fund (FNR), the Swiss National\\nScience Fund (SNSF), and the Research
      Council of the Netherlands (NWO).\\nThe formats of the Swiss, Luxembourg, and
      Dutch research councils all\\nask for some narrative of the trajectory and scientific
      accomplishments\\nof a researcher. The Swiss format requires up to three shorter\\nnarratives,
      while the Luxembourg CV requires applicants to submit a\\npersonal statement
      and a personal profile. The format used by the Dutch\\nresearch council in turn
      is tailored to different career stages, with\\napplicants for more advanced
      funding programs being asked to include an\\naccount of their leadership expertise
      in the narrative. Even the very\\nterm narrative CV is not fully agreed-upon.
      Rather than creating a sharp\\ndistinction between narrative and non-narrative,
      most organizations\\nadopting such formats aim for a hybrid document that combines
      more\\ntraditional list-based information with narrative elements. One could\\nalso
      argue that interpreting any kind of CV\\nformat[](https://valuationstudies.liu.se/article/view/842/1024)[always\\nrequires
      an effort at\\nnarrativization](https://valuationstudies.liu.se/article/view/842/1024){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nso
      as to translate a list of achievements into a trajectory that makes\\nsense
      to human evaluators. These points, as well as the current variety\\nin novel
      CV formats, caution us not to think of narrative CV formats as\\na singular
      new paradigm replacing existing conventions. Nevertheless, we\\nwill in the
      following present some overarching questions that are\\npertinent to most if
      not all narrative CV formats.\\n\\n### Evaluative use of narrative CVs\\n\\nA
      basic assumption that seems to underpin narrative CV initiatives is\\nthat changing
      the way information is presented to reviewers will also\\nchange evaluation
      practices such as the issues discussed in review\\npanels. Yet this seems a
      rather strong supposition. If we think of peer\\nreview not simply as a mechanism
      for objectively comparing information\\nabout applicants but as a practice that
      is learned through socialization\\nin academic communities, then we should assume
      that making use of the\\naffordances of novel CV formats is not something that
      comes overnight.\\nInstead, we should perhaps expect a gradual process in which
      researchers\\nbecome familiar with the new format and make progressively more
      use of\\nits features. Empirical investigation into this may be useful, e.g.,
      how\\ndo panel members actually negotiate and interpret evaluative criteria\\nwhen
      using narrative CV formats? Do such practices change over time? In\\nthe short
      term, detailed empirical studies that compare how review\\npanels shortlist
      and select candidates when presented with narrative and\\ntraditional CVs would
      be desirable (see\\n[here](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/332844/Narrative%20CVs%20drive%20change%20in%20OR%20practice.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nfor
      a pertinent ongoing research project carried out at Cambridge\\nUniversity).\\n\\nThere
      may also be inadvertent risks in broadening the biographical\\ninformation that
      is given as input for reviewers. First, it may be that\\nsociocultural biases
      have a higher chance of coming to the fore. Imagine\\na scenario where sharing
      personal details such as sexual orientation,\\nage, ethnic origin or simply
      particular life choices predispose\\nreviewers for or against the author of
      the CV. Relatedly, reviewers may\\nbe inclined to evaluate those stories that
      resemble their own more\\npositively, a phenomenon often studied under the name
      of homophily. Both\\nbias and its specific form of homophily risk undermining
      ongoing\\nattempts to foster diversity, equity, and inclusion in academia. The\\npotential
      effects of bias and homophily may potentially be mitigated by\\nunconscious
      bias training, or by assuring reviewer panels are\\nsufficiently diverse in
      terms of gender, ethnic origin, nationality and\\ncareer stages. Again, empirical
      research on these questions would be\\ndesirable. Do bias and homophily occur
      less or more often when using\\nnarrative CVs? Are reviewers more likely to

      Crafting narratives\\n\\nA whole other set of unresolved questions arise even
      before evaluation,\\nnamely in the practice of crafting a narrative. During
      the workshop, we\\nadopted a very broad perspective on representing oneself
      as an academic,\\neven experimenting with the use of AI-generated visualizations
      in CVs\\nthat resulted in [a live\\nexhibition](https://www.np3.nu/resumatic/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      hosted by\\nartists Ruud Akse and Zwaan Ipema in the art space NP3 in Groningen
      (the\\nimages in this blog post have been created during that session). While\\nnarrative
      CV formats currently abstain from any visualization elements,\\nthey do create
      the possibility to frame academic work in ways that\\nhighlight different dimensions
      of contributions. For example, this\\npotentially allows for focusing also on
      desirable but usually somewhat\\nundervalued aspects like actively practicing
      Open Science, communication\\nand engagement with society, teaching, or exerting
      leadership in\\ninnovative ways. And while narrative CVs focus on individual\\nresearchers,
      they principally allow for new ways of showing how\\nindividual researchers
      contribute to collaborative work -- for example,\\nby giving space to account
      for community-building work that does not\\nlead to publications and would normally
      remain invisible. At the same\\ntime, the practice of crafting a narrative is
      also related to\\nsociological power dynamics, for example to the command of
      cultural\\ncapital, which is unequally distributed across researchers in terms
      of\\ndemographic dimensions such as age and social origin. Crafting\\nnarratives
      after all requires much more tacit knowledge about \\\\\\\"how to\\npresent
      yourself\\\\\\\" than a standardized tabular format. In addition,\\ncrafting
      narratives may come easier for some personality types than\\nothers.\\n\\nThe
      prospect of writing a narrative also raises the question of how\\ncoherent the
      biographical account should be. Our workshop featured a\\ngroup work session
      chaired by Catelijne Coopmans in which we took a\\ncritical look at academic
      career advice. Academic career advice\\nresources often appear to help reproduce
      rather traditional assumptions\\nabout what it means to be a successful researcher.
      One of the takeaways\\nwas that the cost of conforming to perceived or real
      career requirements\\n[can be\\nhigh](https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/03/01/oxford-universitys-other-diversity-crisis){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nboth
      to building viable livelihoods and to health and wellbeing. Many\\nresearchers
      still work under the assumption that the goal of doing\\nacademic research is
      to become a professor, while other career paths are\\nperceived as a form of
      failure. In reality, \\\"irregular\\\" trajectories may\\nnot just lead to more
      professional fulfillment on the side of the\\nresearcher, but may also have
      unexpected benefits for society (e.g.,\\nwhen academics engage or contribute
      to industry, social organizations,\\nor government). The narrative CV in principle
      allows for showcasing\\ndiverse trajectories through academic research, for
      example in the sense\\nof creating room to document experience working in other
      fields,\\nprofessions, or experimenting with novel methods.\\n\\nA final important
      concern is of course the time required to craft and\\nevaluate narratives, which
      will often be significant. One way of\\nreducing this work is to aim for a degree
      of harmonization of formats\\nacross organizations. Led by the Royal Society,
      efforts to achieve this\\n[are already\\nunderway](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/research-culture/tools-for-support/resume-for-researchers/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      the UK. A related risk is that narrative CVs could turn into a new\\nbusiness
      opportunity for hired consultants, specialized in crafting\\ncatchy narratives.
      The attempt to \\\"optimize\\\" narrative CVs for\\nparticular funding opportunities
      through such professional support would\\nseem to undermine the intention of
      using new formats to increase the\\ninformational value of CVs, and of course
      it would raise questions about\\nwho has or does not have access to the necessary
      resources for such\\nsupport. Time will tell how researchers will adapt to narrative
      CV\\nformats, and it may be that a critical assessment or change of direction\\nwill
      be required in a few years' time.\\n\\n<figure style=\\\"float:right; margin-left:24px;\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/3bjorn2_300x300.jpg\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"18292\\\"

      A holistic perspective is needed\\n\\nAs this reflection on some of the key
      themes that came up during the\\nworkshop shows, there are lots of opportunities
      but also uncertainties\\nrelated to the recent wave of narrative CV initiatives.
      What is perhaps\\nmost interesting about it is that the current moment stimulates\\nreflection
      on practices of research assessment that are usually taken\\nfor granted. We
      might say that experiments with novel CV formats\\nfunction as a sort of sociological
      breaching experiment, where the\\nfundamentals of our conventional mechanisms
      for distributing science\\nfunding and academic hiring are put up for discussion.
      The breadth of\\nthe questions we raise in this short essay in any case prompts
      us to\\navoid thinking of the introduction of new CV formats as a panacea. CV\\nformats
      are just one element - albeit a particularly important one - in\\na broader
      set of practices of research assessment. Addressing the\\nfoundational problems
      that narrative CV formats are meant to solve will\\nrequire an empirically and
      conceptually well-understood view of the\\nself-reproduction of the scientific
      career system - both in terms of how\\nresearchers plan their careers and present
      themselves strategically for\\nassessment purposes, and in terms of the practical
      functioning of\\nresearch evaluation, as well as the science system as a whole.\\n\\n[[**

      **CHERRIES and RIPEET**\\n\\n[CHERRIES](http://cherries2020.eu){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      is about experiments\\nin Responsible Healthcare systems. The main question
      is how CHERRIES\\nexperiments can help investigate opportunities and challenges
      that are\\nassociated with the role of need and demand within the healthcare\\nsector.
      CHERRIES has 11 partners from 7 European countries -- Austria,\\nBelgium, Italy,
      the Netherlands, the Republic of Cyprus, Spain and\\nSweden. Coordinated by
      ZSI (AT), the consortium brings together\\nheterogeneous actors of the innovation
      ecosystem, including small and\\nmedium enterprises, research institutions,
      universities, territorial\\nauthorities, a hospital and a Civil Society Organisation
      to collectively\\nreflect on and design policy experiments around enabling Responsible\\nResearch
      and Innovation (RRI) in the healthcare sector in three European\\nterritories:
      in Murcia (ES), \xD6rebro (SE) and the Republic of Cyprus\\n(CY).\\n\\n[RIPEET](http://ripeet.eu){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      is about Responsible energy\\ntransition policy experiments. The purpose of
      RIPEET is to support\\nterritories in establishing experimental spaces to address
      the\\nterritorial dimensions of the European Green Deal. RRI-based Transition\\nLabs
      will create collective stewardship of the territorial energy future\\nvia participatory
      instruments and serve as a framework for envisioning\\nsustainable energy futures.
      RIPEET has 11 partners from 7 European\\ncountries -- Austria, Belgium, Finland,
      Italy, Netherlands, Spain and\\nthe UK. Coordinated by ZSI (AT), the consortium
      brings together\\nquintuple helix actors (policy, industry, academia, civil
      society and\\nthe environment); the team is highly inter- and transdisciplinary,\\nbuilding
      on long lasting experiences in RRI, territorial innovation and\\nsmart specialisation
      strategies and energy policy and research. The\\n(RRI) policy experimentations
      for energy transition is investigated in\\nthree European territories - in Extremadura
      (ES), Highlands and Islands\\nof Scotland (UK) and Ostrobothnia (FI).\\n\\nIn
      the remainder of the blogpost we will introduce:\\n\\n1.  The CHERRIES model,
      and where RIPEET is different;\\n2.  The tasks that CWTS is involved in based
      upon our expertise;\\n3.  The learnings of CWTS on working at the science-society
      interface;\\n4.  What we do different in RIPEET, and how our work has developed
      into\\n    a methodology, EXPLORE, which will be described in more detail in\\n
      \   our next blogpost.\\n\\n### **The CHERRIES Model**\\n\\nThe CHERRIES team
      aimed to mobilise territorial stakeholder ecosystems\\nand engaged them into
      regional pilot actions, applying an RRI framework.\\nThe pilot actions include:\\n\\n1.
      \ identify needs in the healthcare sector at territorial level\\n    (through
      a call for needs);\\n2.  encourage the proposition and co-creation of innovative
      solutions to\\n    the identified needs (call for solutions);\\n3.  stimulate
      institutional reflection processes on how to innovate\\n    products and services
      in the healthcare sector through participatory\\n    approaches;\\n4.  present
      evidence-based recommendations for revision of sectoral\\n    policies, strategies
      and innovation support instruments.\\n\\nThe CHERRIES model (below) is based
      upon co-creation activities with\\nstakeholders, and testing in the regions.
      The model works well to\\neffectively develop targeted innovations and provide
      legitimacy and\\nmotivation through inclusion and engagement. However, it still
      lacks\\nstrategic directionality and misses anchoring in regional processes.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/cherries-diagram.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"27862\\\"
      />\\n</figure>\\n\\n  \\nIn the figures below, the topics of the healthcare
      innovation in the\\nthree CHERRIES regions are depicted. Each of these pilot
      actions as such\\nis carried out by local actors in a democratised fashion.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/CHERRIES-murcia-orange-ribbon-hand.png\\\"\\nstyle=\\\"width:75.0%\\\"

      data-image=\\\"27867\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\n  \\n\\nRIPEET follows a largely
      similar approach with some changes. In RIPEET,\\nthe regions each form a so-called
      Transition Lab, which is based on [the\\nevolutionary model of socio-technical
      transitions (Geels and Schot,\\n2007)](https://co-munity.net/system/files/Geels%20and%20Schot%202007%20-%20Typology%20of%20sociotechnical%20transition%20pathways.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThe
      Energy Transition Labs (ETL) aim to set up spaces for learning,\\ninteraction
      and interconnection between key actors (government, civil\\nsociety, industry,
      academia) to collaboratively produce knowledge about\\nthe current problems
      of the energy sector, the preferred future\\nscenarios, and possible strategies
      to achieve a sustainable vision. It\\nincludes joined reflection, visioning,
      and back casting before arriving\\nat the needs identification and call for
      solutions which was just\\nlaunched (September 2022).\\n\\n### **CWTS tasks
      in CHERRIES and RIPEET**\\n\\nIn CHERRIES, the role of CWTS is on tasks where
      the project can benefit\\nfrom our expertise in RRI and regional innovation.
      We are involved in\\nthe\\n[mapping](https://dx.doi.org/10.22163/fteval.2022.543){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nof
      existing local knowledge, qualitative work regarding the local policy\\nmix
      and the project's overall impact assessment / evaluation.\\n\\nThe mapping included
      a) identification of regional stakeholders in\\nhealthcare, research, policy,
      and industry; b) collecting (national and\\nregional) policies on smart specialisation,
      RRI aspects (including those\\nreflecting the RRI-keys, such as Public Engagement,
      Ethics, Open Access,\\nGender Equality, Science communication and governance)
      and healthcare\\ninnovation; and c) mapping of regional science and technology
      strengths\\nbased upon bibliometrics and project analysis. The rationale for
      the\\nlatter being that regional innovation benefits from local strengths.\\n\\nThe
      policy approach in CHERRIES departed from the idea how\\n[technological change
      (invention, innovation, diffusion) is faced with\\nmultiple market, system and
      institutional failures and thus requires\\nmulti-faceted policy interventions
      (Weber and Rohracher,\\n2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733312000613){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nA
      policy mix which combines several policy instruments would be the\\nresponse
      to this challenge. However, during the project, the interactive\\nsessions with
      the regional partners on policy revolved around two major,\\nrelated, issues
      that are prerequisites for developing appropriate policy\\nmixes: How can we
      develop arenas for deliberation that bring together\\nstakeholders from different
      backgrounds to allow them to discuss policy\\njointly, and how can we make the
      pilot actions sustainable? As with many\\nprojects, there is no answer to what
      comes after the pilot.\\n\\nThe monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is currently
      ongoing. The focus is\\non M&E of the territorial experimentations led by the
      local partners and\\nthe overall impact assessment of CHERRIES as a project.
      In addition, M&E\\nactivities take into consideration the translational abilities
      of an\\ninterventionist project like CHERRIES locally and the changes these
      can\\ntrigger. Hence, M&E is both inward and outward looking. It builds upon\\nsystematic
      collection of information in bi-monthly evaluation sessions\\nwith the regional
      partners on how implementation of smart specialisation\\nand RRI is taking place,
      complemented with a site visit and evaluative\\nconversations with stakeholders
      beyond the regional partners to assess\\nhow CHERRIES may have affected or even
      changed local policy and\\npractice.\\n\\nIn RIPEET, CWTS is involved in similar
      tasks.\\n\\n### **The learnings of CWTS on working at the science-society interface**\\n\\nSince
      2014, CWTS is involved in Responsible Research and Innovation\\n(RRI), through
      a range of activities and H2020-funded projects (e.g.\\n[MoRRI](https://super-morri.eu/morri-2014-2018/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\n[NewHoRRIzon](https://newhorrizon.eu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      [SUPER\\nMoRRI](https://super-morri.eu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}) bringing together
      R&I\\npartners across Europe knowledgeable on RRI from different perspectives.\\nOften
      these partners are universities, research institutes or\\nnot-for-profit research
      organisations, for which 'the project' is an\\ninstrument to do research whilst
      engaging with others in the field. In\\nCHERRIES, 3 partners represent such
      a research background, of which CWTS\\nis one. The aim of the RRI projects funded
      through the (SwafS) programme\\nfrom an EC perspective is to bring RRI to the
      region, or to implement\\nthe European-oriented RRI policy in regional contexts.
      One of the major\\nlearnings is that there is a big gap between 'a policy' (RRI
      in this\\ncase) and bringing it to life in actual research and innovation\\npractices.
      While co-creation is put central, projects such as CHERRIES\\nand RIPEET require
      translation between the stakeholders involved and\\ntheir diverse needs and
      wishes and the researchers in the projects.\\nStakeholders occupy different
      worlds and want and need different things\\nfrom our projects. It is important
      to become aware of this diversity.\\nDrawing on [Michel Callon's sociology of\\ntranslation](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-954X.1984.tb00113.x){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nseveral
      challenges needed to be addressed in the 'problematization,\\ninvolvement, enrollment
      and representation' in CHERRIES: Who actually\\ndefines the regional healthcare
      problem? Project partners, stakeholders,\\nfunder?\u200B When involving and
      engaging with non-academic stakeholders: who\\ntakes ownership of processes,
      what are power dynamics and how do we\\ninclude diversity?\u200B And thirdly,
      how do we translate projects into\\nrepresentative and effective narratives
      and indicators, that fit with\\nthe local needs and contexts. One of the major
      conclusions is that RRI\\nas a policy when put into practice is operationalized
      differently in\\ndifferent contexts, and that these contexts should lead the
      way. The\\naction research approach we eventually developed [around evaluative\\nconversations](https://repository.fteval.at/604/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      works\\nwell.\\n\\n### **What we do different in RIPEET**\\n\\nWhilst CHERRIES
      and RIPEET are different in their topic (healthcare and\\nenergy transition)
      and regional partners, they are similar in their\\nset-up and approach. Because
      we started with RIPEET exactly a year\\nlater, we at CWTS were able to improve
      how to connect our contribution\\nto the rest of the project. This was particularly
      relevant since in\\nCHERRIES we realised that preparing a mapping, including
      bibliometrics,\\ngoes well beyond the interest and understanding of the partners.
      In\\nother words, to make our contribution useful for our partners and\\nbeyond,
      we as well should translate the needs and adjust our work. In\\nRIPEET, we therefore
      worked much more demand-driven, leaving the lead to\\nthe regional partners,
      as the mapping should serve their purpose, and\\nnot necessarily our own ideas.
      So the mapping exercise became an\\nintegral part of the Transition labs, and
      was co-created with the local\\npartners. Interestingly, the joint mapping,
      in an iterative process,\\nresulted in partly similar topics of attention (CWTS
      and region), but\\nalso additional ones that were shaped by local context and
      needs, and\\nalso, types of partners involved in the process. As such, the ownership\\nof
      the mapping process was better accounted for.\\n\\nOur work, combining mapping
      and evaluative conversations to serve both\\nRRI and Smart Specialisation (a
      regional innovation policy) has\\ndeveloped into a methodology, EXPLORE, which
      will be described in more\\ndetail in our next blogpost.\\n\\nIn conclusion,
      the territorial RRI projects have allowed us to travel\\nand explore the science-society
      interface by engaging with local\\nnon-academic stakeholders from the start;
      to become embedded action\\nresearchers in a co-creative process, and to realise
      that it takes a lot\\nof effort to bring science out of its own world to society.\\n\",\"published_at\":1663833600,\"updated_at\":1708703227,\"indexed_at\":1708118497,\"authors\":[{\"name\":
